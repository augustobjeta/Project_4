DEBATE videos -
There were 3 debates in 2016: September 26, 2016, October 9, 2016,October 19, 2016. We haev aimed for an equal distribution of videos from each "type" of media sources. The types are Right and Left. An important note Pew research article(https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2014/10/21/section-1-media-sources-distinct-favorites-emerge-on-the-left-and-right/) showed a great sspread in trust and sources left of the center in regards to American politics. for this reason we have a range from mid to mid left news sources in an attempt to represtent "the most" Americans perspectives.
