2020-03-10T06:34:06Z,@richardgreen1050,ltNVyvK8Paw,"Friends we need to shut down the special jurisdictional courts in this country and restore the common law courts before the end of Trump's presidency. If we fail to restore the Constitution to it's rightfully place and get rid of the few government added amendments restoring the restrictions of taxation by the government we will still be hot anytime they vote themselves a raise. We need also to return all of the rights of the people as confirmed in the Constitution. Find all of the laws that contradict it and abolish them. We also need to limit those working in the three branches of government to only on branch of service for a lifetime. Executive legislative and judicial should not mix or have the powers of the other. No one in the judicial should be in the legislature and no one in the legislature should be in the executive branch. This thing of lawyers running everything is asking for trouble because as one lawyer said so correctly ""lawyers are liars"" and to often they use words not inclin d to be used by the people in conversation that have a different meaning making us all subject to deceptions and ment to deceive us, for their advantage. Our people perish because we lack the knowledge we on e had at the beginning of our country. Let us look to their example as one British soldier said when explaining to his commander why he did not arrest the colonists "" I tried but it veryone of them knows the law and I couldn't arrest them as to do so would have turned out the entire town, because they all know the law. "" Law books were the most popular books at that time and they should be the same today as then so that the person wronged by authorities claiming a right to arrest are known by everyone to be acting wrongly and the entire town turns out to correct the mistake.",2020-03-10T06:34:06Z

18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.

            新形态的媒体力量----自媒体

        如今社会几乎人手一部手机，再加之互联网的不断升级，手机逐渐成了大多数人日常生活必不可少的一部分。看新闻、浏览资讯、买东西、出行等都可以靠手机完成；更重要的一点，手机似乎成为了当下大多数人平常娱乐的最大来源。刷抖音快手、看段子鸡汤、看创业成功学，越来越多的人开始注意到这一点。这也是自媒体这一新兴行业逐渐兴盛的最大原因。

        时至今日，自媒体已经完全脱离主流媒体，自成一派；而自媒体也不再仅仅局限于文字内容，衍生出了更多的形式，诸如短视频、图片等一切可以承载作者思想以及内容的东西统统都可以称之为自媒体。

自媒体的门槛也是逐渐变得更低，只要你会使用互联网，能认字，哪怕学历不高也能进入这一行。也正是因为这一点，不少人都选择进入自媒体进行创业。那么，自媒体创业该如何起步？

首先，最重要的一点就是要对自己有一个全面的认识。简单来说，对于内容创作，自身有哪些优势？是文笔特别好还是创意点子特别多？是能进行视频拍摄还是会视频剪辑？这是一个自媒体创业者的武器。如果自这些方面都平平，那么就需要不断地学习强化自己在这方面的能力。

其次，一定要熟悉各大自媒体平台的机制，比如推荐量是如何计算的？流量分发机制是什么？各大平台的侧重点有何不同？对于内容的要求是什么？这都需要经过一段时间且系统的摸索。作为个人而言，刚入行的时候建议主攻一个平台，集中精力做好原创内容，才能在更短时间内获得更多的平台权益。

第三，就是要熟悉自媒体的运营技巧。这是一个自媒体创业者想赚钱必不可少的技能。自媒体运营涉及到方方面面，但都不外乎围绕“如何积累粉丝、如何引流、如何变现”这几方面。如果是从来没有过这方面经验的人，最好的建议就是，第一，像资深的行业人士学习经验；第二，通过在日常运营中满满摸索，向平台大V看齐。

“说一千道一万”，自媒体创业门槛不高，但也就意味者竞争压力的剧烈。现在自媒体平台五花八门，相关从业者也不在少数，最重要的一点，自媒体已经过了流量红利时期，创业想赚钱就一定需要优质的内容输出才能保证流量。这背后需要付出的努力，可想而知。
同样做自媒体，为什么有的人能月入数万，有的人却连电费都收不回？

自媒体，有很多路子，比如自媒体平台发布文章，视频，有播放就有收益，还有一种，就是通过快手抖音啥的，积累粉丝。开直播卖货变现！！周期比较长。但你一旦红了，收入不可想象！
今天拥有一百万订阅者一一出现，让人倍受鼓舞，我们一起加油！希望你我他之中出现有100万订阅者的自媒体。",2020-03-07T01:05:17Z

2016-09-07T02:35:14Z,@sammunro9762,FEgykfioeuw,"I am particularly concerned about Donald Trump's policy on the ¨great wall”. Trump says “ We are going to build a great wall, this wall is going to be paid for my mexico, people are not going to be able to tunnel because we will have tunnel technology.” Trump met with Mexico's president Mr. Pena Nieto last Thursday to discuss the plan for this ¨great wall¨. Trump said the two of them did not discuss the issue of forcing Mexico to pay for the border wall. But later that day Mr. Nieto said during his meeting with trump, he made it clear that Mexico would not pay for the wall. If Mexico is not paying for this wall to be, then who will? The border of Mexico is roughly 2,000 miles long, underlining four states from Texas to California. This is a huge amount of land. You do the math. That is a lot of unnecessary money spent. The Berlin wall was just 96 miles and it cost 25 million, with a 200 million inflation. Building a wall to keep out immigrants is a terrible plan. 670 miles of fencing was put up during the Bush administration Secure fence act of 2006. That alone cost 2.4 Billion dollars. In conclusion, Donald Trumps policy of the “great wall” is a terrible idea.",2016-09-07T02:35:14Z

Because America is still in danger of Hillary becoming POTUS. Not because the majority want her, because the VAST majority DO NOT, but because the establishment are surely going to try and steal it.

Citizens from other countries urging Americans to vote for Obama because he would change Washington and make the US better.

    to Cyrus, whose right hand I take hold of
to subdue nations before him
    and to strip kings of their armor,
to open doors before him
    so that gates will not be shut:
2 I will go before you
    and will level the mountains[a];
I will break down gates of bronze
    and cut through bars of iron.
3 I will give you hidden treasures,
    riches stored in secret places,
so that you may know that I am the Lord,
    the God of Israel, who summons you by name.
Then it says this:
I summon you by name
    and bestow on you a title of honor.

The greatest feat of arms of Donald Trump is just to have been able to build a prolific empire. He projects the image of a seasoned businessman.

Rightly or wrongly, because of its commercial success, it lends him negotiating skills, administrator and strategist. Three qualities we look for in a president.",2016-11-06T20:58:02Z
2016-11-06T20:42:13Z,@SORIASO,KIKNSZ_Nf3w,"People need to stop acting like the system is rigged during this election. Americans need to stop acting like the past several elections hasn't been riddled with a bunch of candidates who prey on the misfortunes and inadequacies of others to gain a vote. The past presidents have all been corrupt and all made false promises at the expense of communities that they appeared to have catered to. The main concern I have now is how people all of a sudden have chosen to take a stand during this critical moment to start transforming into ""Che Guevara"" revolutionary types. Where was all this kind of talk in the prior elections. We could have used this outspokenness when Bush, Clinton, Bush Sr, etc ran for president. There could have been numerous emails that could have been leaked during that time period to favor each candidate. However, the vast majority seemed to have glanced over the corruption and go about their daily lives. The issue I have is that people chose to become ""woke"" during an election that can have dire repercussions. Had this election occurred a couple years ago there is no doubt that Hillary would have won hands down. Please don't tell me that there are no Russian ties connected to the Wikileaks of HRC emails. Russia has a vested interest in ensuring that this election is won by Trump whom has provided a platform for individuals with prejudice and racial bias to express their opinions which they would normally keep to themselves. Trump has opened the eyes of millions of Americans who believed that America was home of freedom of race, religion, etc. Now we know who are neighbors are and how they think. Every Trump picket on a lawn is an exemplary of a people whom have a misguided disdain for minorities like myself. People whom I used to wave good morning too I just shrug now because I am aware of their motivations and intentions. This is the first time I am voting because I have always claimed the system is rigged and controlled by the world's elite. Had I voted earlier, I can most certainly guarantee that i would have voted for Ron Paul. In this election, had the opposition not been a symbol of hate, oppression,  and racism, I would like to believe that I would have voted for Jill Stein. I do not like HRC even though I lived in NY and applaud her genuine service to families and children and the education system which cannot be ignored. However, I will vote for her in this one election because my conscience will not let me live down casting a ""meaningful"" vote to a candidate that will not win at the expense of letting someone who will tear society down as whole and bring to the surface the white supremacist and white privilege tendencies in many Americans. I will vote for HRC not because I like her but because I will not vote for a man who demeans my people and whose career has shown that he is as selfless as they come and only cares about ensuring that his business ventures and properties flourish no matter whose toes he must step on. Next election i will return to my independent party but I have to take one for the team and ensure that Trump's campaign (and followers) do not assume more power than they already have.",2016-11-06T20:42:13Z

2016-11-06T20:38:07Z,@menachimkugelmann5175,KIKNSZ_Nf3w,"The gloomiest and most frustrating result of the upcoming presidential election has once again been fixed before the first vote is cast on election day: The American working class doesn’t give a damn for improving its ‘lot' because it has not gotten the least smarter about its objective condition during the eight years of impoverishment under the Obama administration. Another disprove of the old saying that one learns from damage. US workers have not seriously taken time to educate themselves about the strange ‘economics’ of a mode of production that systematically ‘transforms' their drudge into money wealth and private property of a ruling class that doesn’t need to work ‘because' it luckily takes up the burdensome job of vying for the expansion of its capital by - mostly legally - appropriating more of other people’s labor. (Among good American workers these better fellow Americans are unfortunately not known as what they objectively are but as entrepreneurs, landlords, investors, asset managers, financiers that create and save jobs for working people.) 
Moreover the American working people haven’t wised up to the shrewd essence of the democratic form of political rule that is rightfully so highly esteemed by the pundits of the free press and political science. By carrying out elections the democratic state periodically mobilizes its people to decide what competing pack of its elite will wield the political levers of power that are necessarily directed against the same people. Whoever one votes for, the newly elected political administration of the capitalist state can cash in on the general consent given by the voters in their voting acts that they want to be ruled by the old or a new adminstration. The economic conditions of one’s daily life, war and peace, … all is now the reaffirmed business of a reelected old or freshly installed ruling gang and for working people the daily grind remains to be mastered and certainly the task of coming to terms with whatever is politically executed against them for the higher good of American national wealth and global power. The democratic vote is not a means of the people to make government serve them, it rather sets the government free to more efficiently harness those that have to live on wages for national capitalist wealth production, since the government can now play down all discontent by refering to being legitimized by the vote of the people. The choices presented on the ballot make sure that this fine outcome of the electoral process for the political machinery is never up for choice. There is nothing that offers less freedom of choice than a democratic ballot. The 2016 presidential campaign could not demonstrate more causticly what is the bitter truth of democratic freedom: 'Wall Street’s crooked Hillary’ faces off 'the Donald’, a racist blowhard that brags about a real estate wealth he luckily himself had not to lift one brick for or let alone calculate a static of. Perhaps there is something better for working people to do than to participate in elections that offer such moronic choices between factions of the ruling class. What about first starting to rigoursly think about an economic system that produces immense wealth and unseen productive capacities while it systematically let millions of people who pay for it with their labor not pick its fruits. The practical conclusions to be cogently drawn from such theoretical endeavors - so much I like to reveal - would certainly not result in rushing back the ballot boxes.",2016-11-06T20:38:07Z

The strongest and most lasting impression I got (I'm sure it was universally shared out there) from the almost 6 hours (arriving at the venue to the time it was over) was this: I was one guy in a crowd of easily 5,000 other poeple, total strangers, and I felt I was among good friends through and through. I haven't witnessed a single instance of unkindness, of rudeness, of unwillingness to chat with total strangers. I've never felt anything like it in my whole life... And I thought, ""Wouldn't it be great to see a movement where every Trump rally crowd (and there have been some that counted more than 15,000 ppl) would coalesce after the rally into a brand new township and become a distinct new settled community with its own local government, its own local economy, law enforcement, school district, etc.? Where all the residents would have the sense they are truly home among friends they can trust and like, and entrust their kids to?"" And believe me, those would be towns diverse enough even to the most doctrinaire high priests of the Diversity Religion: the crowd I saw was NOT just white guys, it was as diverse as any crowd at any major sports event - all races, men and women in about 50/50 mix, all age brackets, all coming together united in a shared sense of values, hopes, convictions and aspirations... I hope and pray that one day a movement like this will emerge - and when it does America as we've known it will cease to exist, because the Hillary/Sanders rally crowds won't want to have anything to do with us. They will go their own - perhaps similar way - and they will have an America of their own. I just wonder how long their America would survive under their kind of government...?",2016-11-06T19:52:41Z

I was there, I got pictures from the outside of the venue where the line of people waiting to be admitted stretched twice around the building. Everyone who wanted to attend most likely filled in an online ticket request (even though the gate keepers didn't asked for them at the door). So Trump's people have a clear sense of how many people attended, based on the count of those online ticket requests filled.

As to Reno, I think it was a false alarm - no way a gun could get in, as they go through the same thing they have in airports with metal detectors. I just think that Secret Service needs to put a taller guy to be the first man to shield Trump - who is very tall and slow to duck, so a taller guy than Trump who is 6,2 would need to cover him fully.  

Excellent work by RSBN who will have a great future with President Trump. I think he´ll continue this approach during his administration - social media, broadcasts etc. I think he´ll want to have status reports of his work and of the House and Congress to get the Republican agenda going - all this directly to the people, since the mainstream media proved to be his enemy. 

One thing I have to say though - I don´t think it´s OK for some angry folks to go to the media folks and call them names - those people there are the small folks, interns and low level reporters. Even when there is the big guy reporter like Jim Acosta, if the audience looks crazy and insults him and CNN, the cameras catch all that to prove that Trump folks are the deplorables H talked about. It´s good that RSBN cameras are there as when folks go to Brad or Adam, they are laughing, sending hearts, showing posters, dancing - this helps break the tension of those angry folks insulting the press...",2016-11-06T09:13:25Z

November 3, 2016 Tuesday.  What ever happened to the day before, which 
on all pagan and Christian and voodoo who do we do calendars was 
Halloween--that is, Monday, October 31, 2016?  And why were there so 
many ""Examiners"" on display?  And why was someone coming by to scoop up 
all of the papers in one newspaper box right practically across the 
street from the huge AMC that is now featuring South East Asian cartoons
 near the old Moscone Center and right near Denny's and the diner across
 the street from Denny's? Right in front of my eyes, no less, did I see 
some brave and bold soul scooping up all of the newspapers that were 
either fit to print or not fit to print at that corner.  And guess what 
else? This morning on Market St. not that far from the Old Ferry 
Building and where Howard and Folsom Streets sometimes meet and greet, 
someone else--this morning being Thursday November 10, 2016--was right 
around six a.m. Pacific Time doing the same thing that was done the 
night before right in front of my eyes--taking out every newspaper in 
one locked newspaper container.  San Francisco, what gives?  Strange 
days for certain.  That is what lives.",2016-11-10T18:41:40Z

We need to protect our country & citizens better and start up holding the laws that our current government has not been enforcing under Obama. We need more jobs & more affordable housing. We need affordable education and lower taxes.  A lowering of company industry regulation would also encourage and bring companies back to America again. This would also help our oil, gas, steel, lead, & coal industries. One thing for sure we do not need people who wish to destroy our constitutional rights to own firearms.

I never believed in what is written in that book. 
I am also Christianophobic, the reason is simple, I read the Bible.
I never believed in what is written in that book. 

The truth is that if you take the time to read those religious bestsellers you realise that the message is similar, 
they make the apology of hatred and both dare to say that you shouldn't kill while telling you to kill, 
either the Jews for a book or the person who works on the sunday for the other. 
One is Hitler, the other is just dumb. Both are wrong and deliver no message of peace what so ever. 

Religion caused every war in this world and if you need to count how many deaths happened due to a religion or another to assert that one religion is better than another the cult of the giant invisible pink unicorn never caused any death. 

I am Atheist, I refuse to being associated with an ideology that can't be proven neither right nor wrong but rather prefer to admit that I cannot possibly know if a god exists and I do not care if they do exist or not. 
What I do know for a fact, however, is that those religious books, depict the same inhuman behaviors against people not believing in them. 

How can I do that, you ask ?
Simple enough, I took the time to read their book. 
And what I saw is beyond belief and can only be depicted by the words ""Unfounded hatred"". 

If you are Muslim, do not mind this comment, I do not know, I'm just a misbeliever and am not bless with the knowledge of the one and only god. 
If you are Jew, do not mind this comment, I am not Jew. 
If you are one of the multiple segment of what is called a christian, do not mind this comment, I do not believe in your very interpretation, amongst the thousand there is, of christianity, despite, I don't stone my slaves so you shouldn't talk to me.

If you are believing in another religion, congratulations, you made your way to the end of the comment and probably do not care whether I believe or not in your god or gods, do not mind this comment (as you wont).",2016-07-31T09:41:01Z

2016-07-29T20:15:23Z,@adamgm84,F5XmFG3221s,"random canadian reporting in here. i just want to say to anyone from trump's campaign that may read this. you need to emphasize (reference to starting around speech 51:00), you need to emphasize putting money into the lower/middle class pockets. you need to speak to these people directly and say that you will instill fair trade laws that will positively affect their daily lives by requiring money goes to them rather than concentrating to corporations which do not spread wealth back to usa citizens. i believe if you do this and truly seek this, the lower/middle class will improve.

when we outsource to other countries, a benefit of free market capitalism, we maxmize net profit to corporations, but they do not spread the wealth back to usa. they hold onto it and invest it into making more money, but there is no focus on usa citizens and increasing their wealth. that is not the way to stimulate national economy (that is focus on global economy). that is how you benefit the elite. if we required that corporations build locally and force them to make less profit, they will find ways to increase net profit in this model, and we will see more wealth spread back to citizens.

you need to appeal to the logic that free market capitalism eventually leads to one master corporation that holds all the wealth. if they do not pay divend cheques to citizens, where does all this money they make go? its not possible for it to increase wealth of usa citizens if the citizens are not able to spend more money in the same economy. sure chinese welded metal results in a cheaper product, but how can citizens afford that if the money savings dont go back to them? there are many problems here and trump is ALMOST appealing to this notion, but he is missing the critical focus and emphasis on putting the money into usa citizens. he is appealing to this, but he needs to better highlight why the corporations are concentrating wealth but not spreading it back. you have to make the citizens aware of why concentrating wealth to corporations does not help individual citizens except for the 1% that have access to the concentrated wealth.

thats my opinion anyway. i hope some are able to derive logic from it.",2016-07-29T20:15:23Z

The reason ""why"" I ask is because he appears to be soooo PRO AMERICA. 

If he is so PRO AMERICA, wouldn't he want to keep his MONIES  on ""American"" soil, regardless to how much tax you have to pay on your investments/funds, etc.?

I also wonder ""if"" all of the jobs created by Donald Trump is on ""American soil"" or does he OUT SOURCE? 

If he is utilizing out sourcing wouldn't he be taking JOBS away from ""American"" citizens by allowing foreigners to fill the positions abroad?

Doesn't Donald Trump own buildings in other countries, other than America? When he built those buildings did he ""SEND"" Americans over there to construct those buildings? If he didn't, isn't that taking JOBS away from American laborers/workers?

How far do ""EVERYTHING AMERICAN"" go with Donald Trump?

Is it a possibilty that TRUMP just want to see his name on another building-preferrably in the WHITE HOUSE. 

Does he want to be PRESIDENT because a part of him would like to see the TRUMP name in the history books? 

He does appear to love BRANDING! He loves his ""name"" in lights, on buildings, etc.

In his defense...everybody love to see things ""personalized"" with their name, but I wonder if this obssession with ""his"" name on everything.. is some type of VANITY issue?

Why is it that when Donald Trump goes out to deliver a speech... fights brake out?
This is my first time witnessing such a mess on the campaign trail. It SUPER SUCKS!

Everyone can come to america to be an american, its just the process of becoming one. I do believe that there should be a limit of years to wait for citizenship, so that people arent waiting for 15+ years for the process to be complete, thats just rediculous",2016-07-29T05:20:13Z

2016-07-25T12:29:31Z,@kennye6088,F5XmFG3221s,"Trump will not unite the nation.., in fact he will divide it as it has never been divided before.

Look closely at his speech, and you will see that Trump's actions mimic those of Hitler, during his early days on his run for power.

Law and Order, were the words used by Hitler, Mussolini, and Richard Nixon. And we all know what the world was like, with those three men. 

Nixon's ""War on Drugs"", followed by the same action by Reagan, has left our prisons and jails full of drug users, not drug dealers. And for every drug dealer that is jailed or imprisoned, two to three new ones take its place.  Pablo Escobar, was followed by dozens of drug lord/dealer, with the recent being El Chapo. And others are still waiting in the wings.

We all know that the ""hard/heavy hand"" method of defeating drugs and its dealers is not working. We are only leaving hundreds dead bodies in the streets around the world. There is a better a method, like the one used in Portugal or Holland.

Those methods do not stop drug use, but it does reduce the use of drugs and reduce the number of people going to prison, and it reduces the body count. Saving the public billions of dollars.

The Republican War on Hillary Clinton, is wrong.

Yes Clinton voted for the war in Iraq, as did nearly every Republican. So because she acted in a bi-partisan way, that does not makes her unfit to lead.

Yes Clinton was the US Sec. of State, yet  U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, was the overall ""commander on the ground"". He knew the mission and the problems that came with the mission. He knew first hand the dangers and was advised about those dangers and the lack of safety of himself, his people, and the mission while in Libya. 

Clinton was 5700 miles away, if he had called her and informed her of the dangers, she would have acted on his recommendations. But he did not. As the commander on the ground, it was his responsibility, to access the mission, it completion, and the overall safety of his people and himself. Calling Clinton or anyone else, at the time the shooting had started,  was not going to produce the results that everyone wanted and hoped for.

A rescue mission with hundreds of military men, could have failed. No one knew the sizes of the forces that was involved. There was no good intelligence to rely on.

Libya had gone through a ""civil war"", and millions of people were armed with a lot of fire power. And our military would not know who was friend or who was foe. It could have ended badly, than the lost of four Americans. It could have been worse.

Monica Samille Lewinsky:

Clinton loved her husband. And like all men, we do have our faults.

Hillary Clinton viewed Monica Lewinsky as her friend. She eat with her, talked to her, viewed her as a close and kind person, that she held in a very high regard. But Monica Lewinsky betrayed her. Because if Bill Clinton was becoming a problem, Lewinsky could have went to Hillary or anyone within that circle and told Hillary of the problem. And she could have put a stop to it.  

Lewinsky, like the others, could have told those that they knew, and word could have gotten back to Hillary, so that she could stop that action cold. But they failed her. 

So Hillary did what she knew was best. Protect her man, family, child, and marriage. 

She had to decide, if those actions were political actions, to trap the president, since all men have a weakest for beautiful women. And that it could be a setup of any type.

So Hillary defended the home front. 

To me, that says a lot about Hillary. She is loyal, dependable, and have a code of honor that is rock solid.

Trump cheated on most of his wives. He is not loyal, nor dependable. So watch your step with Trump.

Oh yes, Email. She was smart. So many foreign nations attacks government servers. Just look at Snowden. Even our own, goes for the government servers, that's were the secrets are. Trying to find an IP address in the commercial and private sector, is a bitch. There are 10 to 17.2 billion IP addresses, compared to 140 million government email servers, with 514 million IP addresses. Government servers are easy to find, and hacking them is even easier. Because they all use similar encryption methods, and they all have super computers, that can break down the codes in days or months.  Just ask the DNC.",2016-07-25T12:29:31Z

Just as the Supreme Court would be there to check Pence's anti-abortion and homophobic tendencies.  Of course the vacant seat on the Supreme Court would be theirs to fill.  But even then, can anyone in their right mind, continue denying LGBT rights?  I'm transgendered myself, so I should be concerned.  But the reality is the President's only real power is foreign policy.  Everything domestic is a cooperation between the legislative branches AND the executive.

Many will not be able to understand him, but in time, he will help you learn about himself with results.  He has his agenda, wants to help this country, right now, this country is heading in the wrong direction! instead of arms and wars, he will replace them with positive business deals that will assist other countries as well as the USA.  He has the God given gift of Leading and being tough if he needs to.  Leaders will not mess with him, he will be respected instead, he will make friends who will understand where he is coming from.

The man is delusional and his whole message has an extremely low energy to it that lacks any substantial power. Listen to Clinton's speech with no Bias. if your not programmed to hate and blame her you may see its a message of hope and coming from a woman who's been blamed and blasted by the republicans yet there's been no actual proof she did anything wrong. she may have lied but I'm 100 percent sure this guy is just full of lies. saying Hillary and Obama are responsible for terrorism and police attacks is a lie in itself. it's sad so many are so wrapped up in fear you'd trust such an angry non rational man like this.

I mean, mass unemployment, mass illegal immigrants who want nothing than to hurt me and take my job, mass economic downturn, mass killings, no law & order.

plots and dark doings to scare the quivering masses. And no one on the 
public stage is better at the Big Lie this year than Trump. PolitiFact 
found that 75 percent of his so-called factual statements are “mostly or entirely false.” The other 25 percent were “half true” or “mostly true.” His score in the flat-out “true” column was zero.
But that doesn’t stop him. The more lies he tells, the more popular he is 
with a large part of the Republican base that lives in a world of 
made-up horror and blunt force solutions.
So, hordes of Mexicans continue to rush into the United States, he says, 
when in fact more people are now returning to Mexico than are coming in.
 Syrian refugees are “pouring into the country” when barely 2,000 have 
been admitted. And Trump continues to say “I saw” thousands and 
thousands of Muslims in New Jersey cheering the collapse of the twin 
towers on 9/11, when no such thing has ever been documented. The goal is
 to get you to hate them — Mexicans, Muslims, the object of all your fears.
Aswe enter the holidays, there is one more Trump vow to consider. “If I 
become president, we’re all going to be saying Merry Christmas again, 
that I can tell you.” With Trump, the seasonal salutation may be 
mandatory, and creepy.",2016-07-22T21:26:05Z

Hmmm ... Don't you think this sounds like he intends to do amnesty, but just not quite as big as Hillary?

Time will tell, but I think it is safe to say: ""Told you so.""

Shame on ALIPAC for endorsing this man instead of the sole candidate (Cruz) who has been tried and found true on opposition to amnesty.

Trump is the shiny object who (like most politicians) tells people what they want to hear. But if you pay close attention, you can get hints of what is coming once he gets his way. Sorry to quote Obama, but in this case the words actually seem apt: ""We've seen this movie before."" This is why the pro-amnesty, pro-crony GOP establishment, once it was down to Cruz or Trump, flocked en masse to Trump. He was the one many left standing with whom they knew they could do ""a deal.""",2016-07-22T15:34:54Z

See this from the author of ""Art of the Deal""
Schwartz can understand why Trump feels stung, but he felt that he had 
to speak up before it was too late. As for Trump’s anger toward him, he 
said, “I don’t take it personally, because the truth is he didn’t mean 
it personally. People are dispensable and disposable in Trump’s world.” 
If Trump is elected President, he warned, “the millions of people who 
voted for him and believe that he represents their interests will learn 
what anyone who deals closely with him already knows—that he couldn’t 
care less about them.”",2016-07-22T13:27:34Z
