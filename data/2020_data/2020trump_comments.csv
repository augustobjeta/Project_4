Don't they understand that if they don't go along with the Democratic Party supports the same type of regimes that hurt the country they are coming from?  Didn't they see what the Bush and Obama administrations did to the U.S. and countries all over the world, including their own?  

Look at what the past administrations did to Mexico and South American countries with NAFTA and GATT,  They put millions of farm workers out of business.  THey tried to take over with Monsanto Corn!!!    All of the beautiful varieties of corn (alone) were at risk under these trade deals.  It had to be stopped!  They destroyed Mexico. Think, when you read this.  Stay in your country and fight for a better system that works for the people!  And we will do the same.  How can we help your country if you give up on it?  We can make agreements so we can go to each other's countries legally.  You see Monsanto left the U.S., under President Trump.  They ran away because they knew the product they were selling was death.... but they ran, instead of facing the consequences.  Can people see this?    

I'm all for bringing people into the country, sanely so that, when a person comes to this country, he/she can live a good life protected by our Constitution and Bill of Rights governed by the people and for the people.",2019-05-25T12:54:49Z

Trump's mouth is foul, he lies too much, slanders too many people. He loves them if they praise him but if not he fires them or throws them under bus. Are those characteristics of Christ? The Bible says you will know them by their fruit. What do you think. Trump really exibits the love of Christ. Just a question. None of us are perfect in this flesh, but Trump should be a higher standard before the nation exibiting love as Christ loved. I believe God allowed him there for a several reasons. Jerusalem ,abortion and other things. Hey! In Bible king Cyrus was an evil man,but God used him to do His will. I believe Trump is the Cyrus of the end time prophesies. If you look at Trump's birth date, age, blood moon during his birth and election and many other things. Yes! Put there by God for a purpose,but sad to say will be cast down by God,because he acts as if he is God. He says he is the only one can fix anything. Is he omnipotent. God is. He claims to be the smartest. Is he omniscient. All knowing? God is. Basically I'm saying he's made right decisions and wrong. We all do. But to claim God's thunder is treading bad water. Cyrus did it and didn't end well. All we can do is sit back,watch and pray and wait for the outcome.",2019-05-22T15:01:11Z

People who are contact traced Two participants in the rally did not sign a waiver.  These rallies weren’t offense to anyone with common sense for their failure to take simple steps to prevent the spread of the disease. No distancing . No requirement for masks effectively  negates The protective affect for people who did  choose to wear a mask. No separate sections for people who wear masks. I think the Trump organization set themselves up for a nightmare of litigation. Especially since Trump wants to blame Wuhan for the virus.

For example they like Fossil and Coal industries to prosper and Millions of persons work in these fields but Democrats on the contrary they try to keep these workers unemployed. All these Workers in the Oil and Coal support other industries such as Medical Field, Grocery Chains, Sport Clubs, YMCA's, Federal and County treasuries, Banks and Brokerage companies, Plastic Producing Companies,  etc SO STOPING THESE WORKERS FROM PROGRESS IS A RECIPE FOR DEPRESSION OF THE MARKETS!!!!...….Also, there is a need to reform Police to make it Better and avoid situations like George Floyd from happening in the future but Republicans are Right ""Police"" Can Not be Defunded EVER the crooks will be all over the place, the Traffic Collissions and heated discussions will end in fights, the stores and Banks will be robbed we will return to the ""Wild West"" times & No murder will be investigated. Women will be Raped Everywhere...……. Finally, we Need LESS DEREGULATION FOR BUSINESS since SMALL BUSINESS AND PRIVATE BUSSINESS are THE ONES THAT EMPLOY MOST WORKERS!!!!!

2020-06-22T11:00:11Z,@saff1257,niCxnEyG0SM,"why we need to do more tests:
yes it will cause a spike in the number of cases but we will take into account that we’ve done more tests.
what we need to do instead is go off the percentage of positive versus negative test results.
if you have a sample of 10 people and five of them are positive, five of them are negative, that is a 50:50 percentage!
now if we have a bigger sample of 20 people and 10 of them are positive, 10 of them are negative, that is still a 50:50 percentage!
but if you compare numbers of cases it looks like it’s doubled from 5 to 10. 
this is why we need to increase the amount of tests, but use the percentage of positive versus negative tests. The worst way to go about it is to test less people, it will leave people not knowing if they have it and potentially giving it to others. doing more tests will give us the same percentages, as explained above, it will just allow more people to know whether they are safe or not!",2020-06-22T11:00:11Z

At the same time gets slot of things done that are great for this country. Does not take a salary at the same time. Invest in this country first to rebuild and put people here back to work. Is he perfect by no means no! Who is? Now look at Joe Biden. Over 50 yrs in politics! Enriched himself and everyone of his family members are on the take. Totally corrupt to their core. Not as bad as Hillary but close. Joe is also really old and incoherent most of the time. Biden has no balls against China and other adversaries they would eat him alive. Now take the time to really ask yourself who is the best of the two. It is not even close. Trump in every way is going to be better for this country.

of people in this world. People with human brain who are curious, free
thinking, creative, etc. and, people with sheep brain who like sheep follow
orders, never ask questions, and never think for themselves. In this group are
religious people who are call flock who confess that they need a shepherd and he
is Jesus. Recently another group has been added to this group and is called
Trump supporters (Republicans in general). These groups are like a bunch of
robots and sheep follow a man who is everything that a human being is not. Going
to a rally and ignoring all the evidence that shows that their lives will be at
risk, is even worse than being a cattle or sheep.  On the other hand, this is actually great
because people with brain will wear mask and follow advice from experts and
health workers (protect themselves and others) and people with sheep brain
(Trump supports) will think that it is unmanly to wear a mask and, I hope all
will catch the virus and hurry to meet their makers and leave this world for
people with brain to enjoy. I am asking health worker and doctors to deny
services to these idiots who also happen to be science deniers and, sent them
to churches and cathedrals so that Jesus can save them. I wish Trump holds a
rally every day so that enough of these people will miss the voting in November
instead enjoy a meeting with their makers. We don’t have much time. With a bit
of luck, if Trump holds enough rallies we may just make it.",2020-06-21T05:20:03Z

Not to mention, these tests are known to show false positives.  An entire shipment was found to be contaminated with the virus.
AND HERE'S WHY IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYHOW:
-Wearing a mask is the equivalent of attempting to keep flies out of your back yard by installing a chain link fence.  It's stupid, and it DOES NOT work.
-Doctors are being ordered by their respective states to put COVID-19 as cause of death EVEN WHEN IT IS NOT.  This has NEVER been done before.  That should be alarming to anyone with a functioning brain, and cause you to at least consider that there is some sort of political agenda going on. 
-99% recovery rate
-Overall death rate on the planet (all causes included) is the SAME as it always is.

I get why he's saying that, he has to defend his decisions, but that isn't really accurate. Swedish all-cause mortality per 100,000 for the period from Nov to May is lower than the same period for several recent years and significantly lower than in the 2000s. This is according to data out of the Swedish statistics bureau SCB. It has become abundantly clear that more people will suffer and die because of the response to the virus than because of the virus itself. Half of the world's population has lost its livelihoods. It doesn't take much to figure out the consequences on living standards, health and mortality. Poverty, lack of access to healthcare, drug abuse, suicide. In developing nations it will also cause a sharp increase in starvation and disease. Plus all of the other health problems people have neglected out of fear over this period.

At least Trump understands that advocating for further lockdown is untenable. I may vote for him just for this reason.",2020-06-21T03:23:28Z

Spamming BLM in chat trying to politicize the movement, kneeling to us, basically admitting that they think they're superior. Now they're politicizing the virus when it suits their agenda but silent when they're protesting and destroying black neighborhoods and blaming black people. 
Trump cancelled the TPP day 1 saving millions of jobs. and was the first president in modern history to start a trade war with China and winning in the end, making China pay for the deficit. White liberals are literal clowns that passively support the CCP, because they're unable to think critically, they get news from late night comedians and are too tribal and afraid to see things from a Trump supporters point of view. 
All of this irrational Trump hate started when he called out illegals, Islam and said NO to socialism. It's that simple. Donald Trump is in the way of their insane utopia based on a model from some Nordic countries that don't have 10 people. Biden pushed over 20 wars and proxy wars in his 50 years in politics and had history of racist policies like the crime bill of 95 and pushed for segregation in the 70s. Biden is an evil man and a fraud. 
Thank you president Trump for doing everything in your power to make this country great again despite the insane resistance from indoctrinated communist children that suppressed information from big tech tight jean smug far left liberal authoritarians.

Apart from Italy's Matteo Salvini and Hungary's Viktor Orban there's hardly any politician in charge who was able to flame the powers of community, pride and conviction !

For those sincerely interested in how the left thinks, the more you listen to speeches like this, the more likely you would believe “America isn’t racist and hasn’t been since the Civil Rights Movement.” Whereas the more you look at the numbers, the more you realize it still sucks as much or worse to be Black. Swelling with pride that America is the “most” free and just nation already, is meant specifically to deny racism could exist. Which isn’t racist in the sense of being prejudiced, but the left believes that “checking your privilege” is needed to combat systemic racism so denial and promoting denial is the cardinal sin. I wish people would accept the truth from both sides. If either Biden or Trump would talk about America so proudly like Trump did but say we’re gonna get there instead of we already got there, they would have the best of both sides.

Quotation from The awaited imam mahdi's (Nasser Mohammed Al- yemeni) statement

 it is for you to know with certainty that the disease of the suffocating torment of Allah that you call ‘corona virus’ will not be removed from you except by Allah only. So let the people repent from the worst of sins, the gross indecencies, the injustice to the people, and from the injustice of associating partners [with Allah].
And say:
“Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers.”

And after the repentance let each one of them say:
“O Allah I am Your servant, I ask you by virtue of the fact that there is no God but You, and by virtue of the fact of Your Mercy which you have decreed upon Yourself, and by the virtue of the fact of the greatness of Your Pleasure within, which is greater than the pleasure of your heaven, to cure me of the torment of Corona or to turn it away from me as I am a believer in the caller to the truth from You.

O Allah, remove Your torment from us from whichever direction it comes from, so that we follow the path of the truth from You. And strengthen us to fulfil what we have promised you, O you who intervene between a man and his heart, as we only have Your mercy, You have decreed upon Yourself. If You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers. O Allah You have said in the clear verses of Your book
{And your Lord says, “Call upon Me; I will respond to you.}
[Shurah: 40 - Ghafir - Verse: 60]
So the Dua'a (supplication) and the repentance is from me, and the response is from You and You do not break Your promise. Exalted You are our Lord, your promise is true and you are the Most Merciful. O Allah give us the strength to fulfil what we have promised You to follow the global caller to Allah, the caliph of Allah on Earth the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani. O Allah, make the raising of him a blessing upon us and not a misery upon us because of our turning away from the call to the truth of the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yemeni”.

And whoever refuses this supplication surely the torment of the so-called Coronavirus will befall them. And did Allah make the sign of the Corona virus but a sign of confirmation to the challenge in the statement of the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yemeni that was written on the 10th Rajab [5th March], titled “Corona virus is of the lesser torment short of the greater torment, that perhaps they may repent”?

Openly calling BLM protesters who are exercising their first amendment rights rioters even though just about EVERY time the protests become violent is because of the police. Wanting basic human rights is something we ALL should want. And also, America was literally founded on breaking away from British rule by means of protesting, and finally rioting that eventually that led up to war. We praise that in America today but we don't praise the basic needs for human rights for everyone including people of color. That to me is amazing. Protesting is literally the thing that pushes America forward. Without protesting we would still have slavery, women wouldn't be able to vote, black people wouldn't be able to go to school with white people, segregation would still be a thing, and immigration would still be considered bad, even though it helps our economy. He talks about protecting his rights to not have to wear a mask but yet it's problematic for protesters to express their first amendment rights to peacefully assemble. The amount of hypocrisy is amazing, and very telling about how our president prioritizes certain matters. He obviously doesn't care about the BLM movement, he obviously doesn't care about basic human rights, and he obviously doesn't care about the thousands of people that are being murdered just because of the color of their skin.",2020-07-25T03:52:46Z

2020-07-18T04:31:53Z,@TalkingSoup,mXD4zPY4Ai0,"Fascism. Literal fascism. Ten out of fourteen of Umberto Eco's fourteen points of the features of fascism.The cult of tradition (the mythologization of American history). The cult of action for action's sake (punishing people for petty vandalism). Disagreement is treason (protesters are un-American). Fear of difference (the liberals/Democrats/protesters aren't like us). Appeal to social frustration (that's the point of this entire speech). Obsession with a plot (calling protesters ""ringleaders,"" saying the protesters have a plan to destroy America). The enemy is both strong and weak (the protesters could destroy America if left unchecked, but they are also pathetic snowflakes). Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy (inaction or slowness to respond is seen as just as bad as actually protesting). Everybody is educated to become a hero (our children will learn the ""true"" history of our nation's ""heroes"".) Selective populism (again, the entire point of this speech, to rile up and appeal to a specific group of people, instead of all Americans). 

This is American fascism. It is staring us in the face. And all the comments are people saying how good this speech is. How proud they are. This is the definition of fascism. Just because it's not identical to Nazism doesn't mean it's not pretty goddamn close.",2020-07-18T04:31:53Z

Children and families loose their family all the time because of dirty and hateful cops. He says we want to erase history, We are trying to get rid of the praise that people in the past got for their actions. Mississippi’s flag was a symbol of the confederate. That also says a lot about how black people faced segregation. I’m not saying get rid of everything. I’m saying get rid of the praise.

2020-07-13T05:01:19Z,@TheSepulphagist,mXD4zPY4Ai0,"The 14 Points of Fascism. 
The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”
    The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”
    The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”
    Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”
    Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”
    Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”
    The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.”
    The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”
    Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”
    Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”
    Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.”
    Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”
    Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”
    Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”",2020-07-13T05:01:19Z

You ask me why I love her? Well, give me time, and I'll explain...
Have you seen a Kansas sunset or an Arizona rain?
Have you drifted on a bayou down Louisiana way?
Have you watched the cold fog drifting over San Francisco Bay?
Have you heard a Bobwhite calling in the Carolina pines?
Or heard the bellow of a diesel in the Appalachia mines?
Does the call of Niagara thrill you when you hear her waters roar?
Do you look with awe and wonder at a Massachusetts shore...
Where men who braved a hard new world, first stepped on Plymouth Rock?
And do you think of them when you stroll along a New York City dock ?
Have you seen a snowflake drifting in the Rockies...way up high?
Have you seen the sun come blazing down from a bright Nevada sky?
Do you hail to the Columbia as she rushes to the sea...
Or bow your head at Gettysburg...in our struggle to be free?
Have you seen the mighty Tetons? ...Have you watched an eagle soar?
Have you seen the Mississippi roll along Missouri's shore?
Have you felt a chill at Michigan, when on a winters day,
Her waters rage along the shore in a thunderous display?
Does the word ""Aloha""... make you warm?
Do you stare in disbelief When you see the surf come roaring in at Waimea reef?
From Alaska's gold to the Everglades...from the Rio Grande to Maine...
My heart cries out... my pulse runs fast at the might of her domain.
You ask me why I love her?... I've a million reasons why.
My beautiful America... beneath Gods' wide, wide sky.

he looks like an old, overweight, off-brand Ken™ doll that was melted in a microwave for twenty-five seconds.

still, it's maybe the most _Presidential_ he's ever sounded. though i'm sure you'd agree that's NOT saying much. he couldn't sound Presidential if his re-election counted on it. 

also, the fact that Mount Rushmore was mainly built due to the efforts of a Dannish-American born in an immigrant family is NOT lost on me. the man responsible for the most American landmark possible was named Gutzon Borglum. no, i didn't make that up.

this whole thing reminds me of that scene in _North by Northwest,_ where they're nearly falling off the top of Mount Rushmore, their hands just barely clinching the edge. 

of course in the movie, they made it and lived to fight another day. with Donald i'm not so sure. things are _not_ looking good right now. maybe in four months he'll be re-elected President, and this comment will be ridiculous? maybe. it's absolutely possible.",2020-07-09T18:19:54Z

He conveniently left out the reason for CONFEDERATE statues to be brought down. They represented tyranny and oppression of a race of people. No different than what Hitler did. There are no statues of him. Hey guess what? Saddam Hussein's statue toppled....why you ask? He oppressed a race of people and his own people for that matter. Most intelligent people can distinguish that. I do have a problem if people want to desecrate our founding fathers....which Trump repeated ad nauseum. As for symbols and reminders of a system that reperesents oppression..go for it. Why the blowback? Unless you are a racist. I for one have stereotypes of people I do not know. So yes I can be classified as a racist. We all have these stereotypes....whether your black,white or yellow. And thats the beginning of unification and not division. Admitting to these faults and working to bettering ourselves as a people and country. Trump did not mention once the pandemic or or how to unite us or racial injustice....which started the movement to remove CONFEDERATE SYMBOLOGY!

It sounds like to me that the media believes that if you don't support the rioters we are unAmerican. I am so thankful for the constitutional right to PEACEABLY ASSEMBLE! I am so glad that the police officers who have murdered people are being arrested and charged, but allowing crimes such as the rioters are doing, like the democrats and media are supporting, are showing they do not love the people of our country enough to truly honor Black lives, Brown lives, or any lives, including the men and women who serve on police forces who are good people (I am not talking about criminals disguised as policemen! 
I did have to laugh the other day when I saw the statistics that show China has less prisoners than we do. Technically true the false news is that they don't report the rest of the story. When I person is found guilty of a violent crime (stealing, with or with out a weapon, is considered a violent crime in China) you get one trial and by the end of the week (often by the end of the day) the person found guilty is executed. In other words they don't need as many prisons because they don't keep prisoners alive. 
My Dad lived in China as an English teacher on the university level 3 different school years and saw how they take care of criminals. I don't think anyone here would want the same criminal system they have in China. Comparing ours to theirs is comparing apples to an animal you would want as your loving pet, (way beyond comparing apples to oranges).",2020-07-09T01:28:07Z

Other than saying the “radical left” over and over how about specifics on who exactly they are, how large of a population, and how they’re actually a threat to anyone’s freedom? Tough questions, but considering you’re basically identifying the enemy as fellow tax paying Americans it would be good to know who you think were up against. After all, those 10 year prison sentences won’t pay for themselves. No, I’m not a fan of removing monuments and statues either but it’s not the defining issue your paranoid minions think it is.

Like shrinking the federal government but keeping our military strong, making sure there’s no longer such thing as a homeless veteran, reinvesting in education, reinvesting in inner city churches than can provide community support for young people who feel their only option in life is joining a gang, making sure every child is a planned and wanted child and are raised in a home with two parents, preferably a mother and father who don’t separate at the first sign of marital problems.

2020-07-08T19:47:50Z,@ojshilinski8358,mXD4zPY4Ai0,"​One day in 1964 John Howard Griffin, 44-year-old Texas journalist and novelist, was standing by the side of the road in Mississippi with a flat tire. He saw a group of men approaching him. Griffin assumed the men were heading over to assist him but instead they dragged him away from his car and proceeded to beat him violently with chains before leaving him for dead. It took Griffin five months to recover from the assault. The attack was not random; the beating represented a particularly brutal form of literary criticism: Griffin was being punished for having written a book. Black Like Me, the book in question, had been published three years earlier in November 1961 and it had led to its author being both venerated and vilified. Griffin, a lantern-jawed and chestnut-haired white man, deliberately darkened his skin and spent six weeks travelling through the harshly segregated southern states of America, revisiting cities he knew intimately, in the guise of a black man. On the opening page Griffin set out the question he was attempting to answer: ""What is it like to experience discrimination based on skin color, something over which one has no control?"" No white man could, he reasoned, truly understand what it was like to be black, because black people would never tell the truth to outsiders. ""The only way I could see to bridge the gap between us was to become a Negro,"" Griffin writes. ""I decided I would do this.""",2020-07-08T19:47:50Z

BLM, cancel culture, and extremist leftists/democrats continue to call Republicans the ""Racists""...... while they ironically support the same party that fought to KEEP slavery, implemented Jim Crow laws, founded the KKK, implemented welfare reform in the 70s that destroyed black families, and implemented prison reform in the 90s that destroyed black families even further, and currently have been plaguing every single predominantly black ghetto in the USA as political leaders. You guessed it..... all Democrat.

Democrats have NEVER cared about black people.  They used to control them by force as slave owners..... now they do it by manipulation of the media.

Wake up black America.... you've been duped.  The people your democrat plantation owners have been telling you are the ""racists""..... are the people that want nothing more than to elevate you, and offer you every opportunity this country has....

Republicans have been fighting for your rights since President Lincoln.  Republicans are the ones that WANT you to realize that independence and freedom.

..... Not the democrat ""massas"" that want to keep you poor, keep you ignorant, and keep you convinced that you are a ""victim"" by appeasing you with government scraps (welfare) in exchange for your continued vote.  They've been fighting to keep you enslaved for just as long..... and they are winning, because the majority of black people continue to vote democrat.

Stupid.... just stupid.

President Lincoln was Republican
Dr. MLK was Republican
Malcolm X claimed no party, but was often cited bashing liberalism.

Why do you think that EVERY SINGLE predominantly black, predominately welfare-dependent city in the USA is run by DECADES of corrupt democrat leaders?  You think that's an accident?  IT'S BY DESIGN.  Notice how it's perfectly ok to burn down your own neighborhoods, but as soon as you come to their neighborhood, they call the National Guard?  How do you NOT see the hypocrisy?

But Trump and the Republicans are the ""racist"" ones, right?  

My black American friends....Seriously..... wake the hell up and stop voting against your best interest.

Notice how there's very few comments from the radical left?  There are actually, they are just posed as cowardly responses to others' posts.  There is no argument.  This speech wasn't ""divisive"" like the left so desperately wants you to believe.  It was patriotic, and it was true.

You can't argue with that.

It is great to see a President that is finally speaking for the people in support of the people about things that matter and the truth.,2020-07-08T09:42:12Z

I haven't seen much respect shown by his own people & none from any media outlet at any time. This was a good & epic speech. 
The only exception I took was that he gave wrongful credit to Americans of splitting the atom (a New Zealander did that first) taking the telephone to the world ( a Scotsman invented that) & winning both world wars. That America came into both the world wars very late was conveniently ignored. Apart from wrongfully claiming American credit on those things, it was a good speech & well delivered.",2020-07-08T09:31:46Z

The cult of the left requires complete adherence to its tenets in all their ignorant glory, its doctrines of destruction, history-revision, decemation, defamation, defacing, rioting, looting and lawlessness, all wrapped in a virtue signalling bundle of “social justice”
The giant orange problem for the left is that this president can't be controlled by the liberal machine firmly entrenched within most of the media, and that infuriates the radicals replete within its ranks. Ranks filled with subversive Obama leftovers who slinked out of office when Barry left, after they disastrously harmed this Republic with their weaponization of Federal agencies and illegally spying on Americans when they weren’t attempting political coups, then slithered right into cozy executive positions at all the alphabet stations and everywhere groupthink is the only matra on cable news, to continue their subversion and propaganda campaigns.
 
So the war on truth continues as the war on civility, history, our Founders and safety riots-on in every Democrat controlled city, all in attempts to harm President Trump in the eyes of Americans; to somehow have them unalterably vote for a mentally declined flesh covered tofu block in Aviators, who will just be a puppet for China, AOC and  Ilhan Omar, while his family continues to enrich themselves from every country where American “persuasion” is effective under sovereignty-selling Democrat control..
 
But just as in 2016, Those subversives will win nothing but the justification to scream on the corners of American cities, when President Trump is reelected in a historic landslide. That win will also come with a Republican House and Senate, and a stop to the anarchy and lawlessness Democrats are fostering, funding and falsely believing will lead to the forced constitution destroying ""change"" they want. 
 
Change will come, but it will only be Biden's diapers being replaced as Donald J. Trump prepares to raise America to historic and prosperous heights once again, when he is voted in again not only with the Electoral College blowout, but with the popular vote riding comfortably on the Trump-Train!

MAKE AMERICA GREAT by Acknowledging her scars, binding her wounds and healing her with medicine of Hope and a Better Future... But No... Trump Opens up those scar's, rips off any little bandage and Opens this Country's wounds even more.... And then Wonders why America is bleeding.

The Second Amendment does not give us the right to do anything. The right exists, regardless of the amendment. If the amendment was removed tomorrow, that wouldn't change the fact that the right exists.

The Second Amendment was a clarification, as were all of the original Bill of Rights, that free people retain the right of self defense, and that the federal government was barred from infringing upon that right.

Everyone needs to hear that, the President's comments notwithstanding. His sentiments were correct, but his understanding is a bit flawed.

To reiterate, the right exists, with or without the Second Amendment, which simply made the point that the people retained the right to keep and bear arms.",2020-07-08T00:07:49Z

i hope Trump is considering making that his new 2020 slogan.

""the Not On My Watch hats will be sure-fire top-sellers, because let's face it, they're beautiful. and CNN's army of snakes and weasels will be forced to say 'nom-wuh' while pushing its fake news on American people -- who, by the way, are an incredible people.

Absolutely disgusting, the lies he is preaching, about COVID. incorrect statistics, making people think COVID is completely harmless🤦🏻‍♀️ what a giant F*CKWIT!
Every other country has acknowledged how deadly COVID is, and this greedy, pompous, narcissistic RACIST orange mental case, cannot even recognise those who have died, thanks to his ignorance.
Curious about his ‘wartime president’ claim..... 
A. There is no War     
B. The last war, he got got out of it with a fake medical certificate    
C. He isn’t on the frontline of any state battling COVID      
D. He is deluded. Using wartime, in name only, because he thinks it sounds good, 
E. He’s a COWARD, running away from EVERYTHING going on, in America right now. #BunkerBaby
F. He doesn’t claim responsibility for any problem in America right now, so he has no right claiming he is successful as a leader, as a president, as an American.

His JULY 4Th was a complete flop. He’s a Joke. Let’s see how many attendees will have COVID in 2 weeks.

Don't TELL us we're going to win against the far left, SHOW us. Stop with these silly rallies that are accomplishing no more than getting your base from 33.5% to 33.6% and get these messages to people who need to hear them. ""Democrats are horrible, we stand for the flag, we don't take down monuments, blah blah MAGA MAGA MAGA"" and the crowd, on cue, boos, cheers and ""USA"" chants as expected. Fabulously rhetorical

*I hate to break it to you, but 99% of the people watching this speech are already voting for you.* If you're trying to increase your base and your election chances, it's a waste of time. I'd be much more impressed if this were a crowd of undecided voters but simply throwing red meat to the base? We're already past the point of diminishing returns. Time for a new strategy. Go out into the suburbs and cities, reach out to moderates and center lefts who love your ideas and on EVERY SINGLE POLL support the ideas you support, yet don't support you!!

The belief that anyone can make it in this country if they work hard and apply their god given gifts has been replaces by victim-hood politics and defeatism. Post-modernist Marxist leftists have invaded and mostly taken over our schools from kindergarten to post graduate levels and poisoned naive young minds.

His humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Trumps's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Donald Trump truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Trump's existential catchphrase ""Make America Great Again,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Trump's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂
And yes, by the way, i DO have a 'Make America Great Again' tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",2020-07-06T22:37:06Z

The Bolshevik leftist city managers need to all be prosecuted for sedition against America. They need to be sued for the violence and destruction they allowed. The rioters need to be confronted in the streets by Americans who will not stand by idly and hope for the best. And we need 4 more years for Trump to continue to correct the total mess that was made by the previous seditious president.,2020-07-06T21:20:58Z

2020-07-06T20:49:29Z,@robertsocha9972,mXD4zPY4Ai0,"Getting a history lesson from this guy is like getting....a grammar lesson from this guy.  I have to admit, it's the best reading of the teleprompter I have ever seen by Trump.  So, let's break down what you are hearing and why.  At this time, we have two major national crises:  1) the coronavirus is surging after two months of lockdown in most places and 2) a major reaction to unequal treatment of people of color by the police, leading to peaceful demonstrations (one tear-gassed at the order of the president), some riots, and tearing down of statues mainly connected to the Confederacy or otherwise racist-tinged.

So, how does the president address these major crisis in this campaign speech?  Well, he basically skips the coronavirus.  In a world where we can instantly communicate with people all over the world, we know a lot about this new disease.  Our president has access to the best advice on how to handle the situation.  Unfortunately for those of us living in the USA, he is just doing...something else.  I don't know HOW he managed to turn wearing a face covering into a political hot topic, but he did.  Seriously, when everyone who knows anything about how this particular virus spreads and how to stop it, why would you not recommend your citizens to do this, and to model the technique in good spirit?  It's not a political issue that you can run for reelection on.  It's just how you stop the spread of the virus.  So, obviously he doesn't want to talk about this because he's aware that he is failing (and STILL refusing to try to handle the situation!!!).  The only peace of mind I have over this is that his voters are defecting as they realize his failure.  Still, I would rather the president be successful in saving tens of thousands of American lives that to watch his continued failure.  As I watch this speech, I see that once again he has encouraged a large, predominately unmasked crowd to squeeze together, which we contribute to the spread of the virus.  I feel bad for the families of those in the crowd, I wish they understood what they are doing.

#2.  When I was younger, I would see black comedians joking about how they would be pulled over by the police all the time, how people would cross the street to avoid them, etc.  So, they got their laughs, and I guess, being white, I assumed that this was exaggerated.  With the advent of cell phone videos, we know now that some really awful things happen to people of color at the hands of the police.  Bad apples?  Once you have so many, you would just stop eating apples, I think.  One friend of mine quit clam chowder after just one bad bowl.  Anyway, after the tragic death of George Floyd, frustration not just in the black community, but everywhere, led to massive protests across our country AND THE WORLD.  People want to see justice.  This is already a long comment, so if you don't understand what is going on, go do some reading.  Any good book on the slave trade, the politics that led to the Civil War, Reconstruction (Foner is recommended), Jim Crow era, everything up until the Civil Rights movement to the present.  So, statues are being torn down.  These include many statues of CONFEDERATE GENERALS and SOLDIERS, a SLAVE AUCTION BLOCK (?!), Christopher Columbus, and yes, Washington (a slave owner) did get vandalized.  What is the point?  Why do this?  Well, personally I don't go around vandalizing property.  But when people of color see statues of a regime founded on the principle of slave ownership (Okay, states rights people, crack open your books and start reading.  You are wrong.), you can imagine that they find it a bit intimidating.  Especially since these things popped up WELL AFTER THE CIVIL WAR ENDED.  To them, it can serve as a reminder that many people sill revere the ""good old days"", and we all know what that means.  The founding fathers were not the main targets of this recent purge, but keep in mind that this wasn't a coordinated effort (as far as I know), and that the founders were mostly slave owners, even Jefferson.  Fun fact:  we hear about the Judeo-Christian values of our country often.  Did you know that many of the founders were Deists (look it up)?

So, that fills in some of the essential information that Trump left out of his history lesson.  If you're a Trumper and you actually read this, thanks for giving me your time.  I don't believe you're a bad person...but I believe our president is.  It's the time to think of others and to help them, whether they've been affected because of the pandemic, or because they are afraid to encounter a cop because of the color of their skin.  I just talked a lot...but I think it's also a time to listen.  Be safe, please wear a mask and practice social distancing.  Treat everyone else the way you would like to be treated.",2020-07-06T20:49:29Z
2020-07-06T20:47:10Z,@Beezewhiz,mXD4zPY4Ai0,"Who is the ""our"" and ""us"" in his statements? How does centuries of racial oppression result in an attack on Trump? Why not even mention the protests for black equality? It's illegal to do the Nazi salute in Germany due to the horrific treatment of a race of people they considered ""other"" and stole their wealth, country, etc. They certainly wouldn't have monuments to Nazis everywhere. We shouldn't have white, sexist, slave-owning monuments to people who stole land and massacred dissenters. Like the Nazis, there was historic and systematic segregation, oppression, forced labor, murder...beginning to sound familiar?  If you, Trump, believe in the equality you speak of, then why not acknowledge the truth of our history?  George Washington and Thomas Jefferson owned slaves. They owned people. And certainly saw them as subhuman and benefited from their children, blood, bodies, labor...they enslaved people. This speech given the protests going on and this time in history is clearly invoking white supremacy and scoffing at the call for equality. And yes, many immigrants are likely treated better than black Americans. This isn't defiling ""your institutions"", it's asking educated questions about a white-washed history. This kind of jingoistic babble is meant to gaslight a legitimate cry for fairness and equality.",2020-07-06T20:51:42Z

The economy before the virus was inherited from the time of Obama. The Federal Reserve has kept interests rates low for years. The ""Federal"" Reserve controls the money supply. By the way 90% of the money supply comes into existence via commercial bank loans. The other 10% is The Federal Reserve Bank buying or selling U.S. Treasury Bills. The proof of this is the national debt. If the U.S. gov't created our money supply, it could never be in debt.  The American people are totally ignorant, and never taught how our money supply works, and believe the President and Congress control our economy. No! The private Federal Reserve System controls our money supply.

According to a report from CNN, Donald Trump is deathly afraid of getting the COVID-19 virus and is pressing White House aides to come up with ways to protect him from being infected while at the same time downplaying the health crisis to the public.

With Trump refusing to wear a mask in public, while at the same time insisting that he be allowed to hold rallies despite health officials warnings, aides to the president are being forced to take extra measures to protect the president.

‘Every venue the President enters is inspected for potential areas of contagion by advance security and medical teams, according to people familiar with the arrangements,” CNN reports. “Bathrooms designated for the President’s use are scrubbed and sanitized before he arrives. Staff maintains a close accounting of who will come into contact with the President to ensure they receive tests.”
Additionally, White House staff are subjected to constant monitoring, including temperature checks.

I look at people as Red White and Blue, .After I see an 8 year old girl in Atlanta be shot due to demonstrations. I can't sit back and say nothing, .I hate Violence . The problem I see with this country is that  there are many times. people are  murdered as others do a demonstration . I also  hate bias, I lived in a foreign country 8 years and was subjected to it almost daily.  I do not understand how anyone can justify  burning out some as they call it a peaceful demonstration.  To say  the whole country needs to change the constitution is also a real bone up my but also.I love peace I have been to places with my asian wife and they ignored us as if they did not see us.  I just pick up never returned and told my friend, I did not go out and get gas and fire bomb the place or make an issue.  I also know how it is to be innocent and walk down the street to be beat up by a bunch of thugs due to skin color . I am white..  I love my country and want peace. Yes i am a gun owner to protect myself. I see that many  people want to take away my 2 amendment.  This is not a political I am voicing my right to free speech.   How  in the world can we help stop all the things we see as  the world is turning up side down.   I hear things like  color privilege   The only thing I ever got I worked for, I have had very little privilege,   Any one who suffers and works their butt off  does not have special privilege . To see people rip down history like statues a is  not a way to change anything, It just make more people angry,  Think about is someone  ripped down the front of your house and said it reminded them that of jesus , lee or columbas, How would you react?.  So this is  A rant you may say, Who cares about this country?   Red blooded americans do. Thats Who. Now call the Mayor in a ATLANTA,  Email all your  state  reps be they democrats or republicans. this violence has to stop,",2020-07-06T10:38:04Z

FDA test passed and approved, which registration serial number is 10062936. You could check it on the FDA website, it’s OK for medical or surgical usage. Please send an inquiry to this email: stephenyaftersale@foxmail.com or place an order on the website: www.superyouke.com if you need any of this.

Superyouke Inc a branch of a famous Amazon car LED light bar seller Nilight, which I have placed many orders from and I do trust their qualities and values for customers. I did some deep investigation and all the information from this supplier was in line with my requirements. This is the first face mask manufacturer that has truly passed all tests and is willing to provide the original certificates since I have bought so many masks from different sellers on Amazon, who were either too expensive or too bad quality.

I ordered 50,000pcs and contacted the local UPS for delivery. It only took a week to arrive at my place STOCKTON, CA and the tracking number is 1Z5586Y20466890012.

The reason I ordered this big amount of face masks is that we do have urgent need for this. As our infected number is growing every days and we need to protect ourselves. I have raised its price a little and made a little benifit for my spent time and energy. Hope this information can help out.",2020-07-06T10:36:25Z

2020-07-06T08:17:54Z,@thinhvo1196,mXD4zPY4Ai0,"While watching this video, I fully support everyone's patriotism towards the United States and our great heroes such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Rosevelt, etc. HOWEVER, I do not support President Trump's claims of US citizens ""destroying"" the United States.
From what I am aware of, we are NOT destroying monuments of US heroes, we are NOT teaching the youth to ""hate"" America via indoctrination, and we are NOT trying to erase US history. 
On the first point, monuments that have been destroyed have been those of Confederate generals and leaders. The Confederacy is not a time in US history that we should be proud of. It was a time in which the US was severely divided and slavery was the main issue of that. Protesters are destroying and defacing these monuments because THEY DO NOT REPRESENT THE AMERICA WE ARE. We should not and are not a nation that divides people by race, color, skin tone, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc. We were founded on the beliefs that -now in modern times- all *people* are considered equal. While we do not want any of these statues up, we are not trying to hide our history either. History can be taught and learned in books. We do not put monuments up of bad things that happen, we learn from these things in books and educate ourselves. I believe President Trump stating that we are erasing history by destroying these statues are false when we all learn about the Confederacy during school, BUT WE SHOULD NOT GLORIFY IT BY PUTTING UP MONUMENTS. 
On another point, the BLM movement is happening because of systematic oppression against black people. You yourself might not think you are racist, but America itself was built upon white supremacy. White people have more privileges than black people, asians, mexicans, etc. The BLM is a protest to CHANGE America to make it EQUAL FOR EVERYONE. I reiterate that America was built upon equality for everyone, and if America itself is not equal, then we should change America itself. Police brutality is a common example of this flaw. The protests state they want to eliminate the police because it is not a good system. We need to change it. Are you scared of the police? Why? IF THEY ARE MEANT TO PROTECT US, THEN WHY ARE WE SCARED OF THEM?
I just want to summarize everything by that while I believe America is a great nation, it is not perfect. We voted for President Trump in order for him to better America and change it for the better. There are so many things that can be done, so many small things that everyone can agree on, and we need changes like that. I just ask for everyone to educate themselves and form their own beliefs and opinions. It's okay to change your opinion. You can change my opinion as well as I believe the best opinions are those that are based on facts.",2020-07-06T08:17:54Z

Why are they still putting so much money into the military instead of helping the homeless? Why is COVID-19 still a political debate about whether it’s real or not? Why is the justice system not always about justice? Why has the school system stayed the same for 100 years? Why can citizens with a higher social status get away with breaking the law? Why don’t American citizens try to stop climate change? Why is racism,sexism, and homophobia still a problem? Actually I can answer that for myself. We have a racist and homophobic predator leading America. If you’re a trump supporter don’t @ me. I already know what you’re gonna say. America is the most successful country, but on the inside there’s so many stupid problems.  If America is so great why are there problems like the ones that I mentioned that can be fixed. The government has the ability to find a solution. The government already focuses more on military and wealth more than anything else. Then proud Americans  worship the flag and all of the the holidays that come with it, so that tells the government that some of the  citizens are happy with America’s current state. I’m not saying it’s wrong to be proud of your country. This country has also done some great things, but to me the bad outweighs the good. I know that some of the problems I have said happens in other countries, but America is supposed to be the greatest country right? So, why is the stuff that I said such a huge problem? There are many more problems with this country, but I listed the ones that came off the top of my head.

2020-07-06T04:12:06Z,@LiloUkulele,mXD4zPY4Ai0,"The controversy over Trump’s rally puts a new spotlight on the decades-long fight by Native Americans to uphold the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty that designates Mount Rushmore and the surrounding Black Hills as part of ""the Great Sioux Reservation, set aside for exclusive use by the Sioux people.""

That treaty, and an earlier version of it signed in 1851, “guarantee [the Sioux] this land where Mount Rushmore sits as long as the grass grows, the water flows and the sun shines,” Brightman says.

Trump’s event also reaffirms the complicated history of the Independence Day holiday for Native Americans at a time when the country is undergoing a period of racial reckoning, Brightman says.

“Some people believe that the Fourth of July signifies America's independence from the British colony, but we actually lost over one billion acres of land, and every inch of this land that we're on here in North America is actually stained with Indian blood,” he says. “And it's ridiculous that we're still fighting. I'm fighting the same fight that my ancestors fought.”",2020-07-06T04:12:06Z

2020-07-06T03:44:41Z,@thenattyg3,mXD4zPY4Ai0,"Umberto Eco's 14 characteristics of Fascism summarized:

1: cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”

2: The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”

3: The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”

4: Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”

5: Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”

6: Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”

7: The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.”

8: The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”

9: Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”

10: Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”

11: Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.”

12: Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”

13: Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”

14: Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”

I think we should get people who think they're in a war against their fellow Americans to talk more. Honestly you all sound the same when it comes to founding values. Talking is part of actually fulfilling them because you can't work together without it.

Anyway, please take this message of love from an Irishman as intended. It turns out we didn't hate each other as much as we all thought before our civil war and the Northern Troubles. Most people (96% in our case) just want to live and let live and disagreements about details aren't the end of the world. They can all be figured out over time without panic. There's nothing wrong with acknowledging how other people feel and what their problem is to see if a solution isn't possible before we dehumanise them or conclude our worst fears about them.",2020-07-06T02:18:01Z

                    ^  This is unrelated to this. VVVVV>>>  !>This is a memo to christian.<<<<!|\ How do you fulfill a contract ,or law ,you do them .
Heaven and earth hasn't pass away.Why do you think the law as been done
away?  The Fulfillment of the Law
17Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. 18For I tell you truly,
 until heaven and earth pass away, not a single jot, not a stroke of a pen, will disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.
19So then, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do likewise will be called least in the kingdom of heaven;
 but whoever practices and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
 20For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
or
Matthew 5:17-20 King James Version (KJV)

17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.
18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.

 Matthew 4:10 New International Version (NIV)
10 Jesus said to him, “Away from me, Satan! For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.

The Wise and Foolish Builders
24 “Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
 25 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. 
26 But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
 27 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.”
28 When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, 
29 because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.

The Narrow and Wide Gates
13 “Enter through the narrow gate.
 For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.
 14 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.

13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.",2020-07-05T20:37:49Z

It's great that the president of the country doesn't even understand what's happening in the country. What's happening is exactly the opposite of what he said. The monuments that have been torn down are monuments to people who stood for slavery. They are not heroes of the United States, they are heroes of the Confederacy; a short-lived failure of a nation that was created for the sole purpose of slavery. They did not stand for our values. Slavery and racism is not what the United States stands for. That is in our past.

Sidenote: I don't agree with the tearing down of the Confederate monuments. However, I do believe they should not be displayed in public. They should be relocated to a museum. It is part of our history, and it should not be forgotten. Having them remain in public, though, seems more like a celebration of the wrong we've done rather than a reminder of it.",2020-07-05T19:18:39Z

2020-07-05T18:55:01Z,@fuknrowdy,mXD4zPY4Ai0,"All of you in here calling Democrats and the left evil, or that they all hate America and want to destroy it completely need to think about what impact you see having. Do you think you're changing minds? The average Democratic voter loves this country just like you do.  There are things they think need to change or are wrong, just like you. They want a better world for their children, just like you. Some of them think Republicans and right wingers are horrible evil people wanting the destruction of everything that makes this country great, just like you. 
There are plenty in power who are wicked, selfish, short sighted, and working to destroy everything this country stood and stands for. If you want to cut through the Marxism infecting many well meaning people acting as their foot soldiers without realizing the machinations of their leaders, calling them evil will never work. That just makes people stop listening. Listen to what they have to say, give carefully considered responses that are more than just the same talking points we all have heard over and over. Be respectful, have an open mind, and come to people on their level. That's how you change minds. Berating them and quoting fox news at the top of your lungs works just as well on them as them screaming their CNN talking points at you. 
This is important. The ones wanting to demolish this country, take our freedoms, turn our society Marxist, etc for their own benefit, want us divided, tribal, and at each others throats. We need the left and the right to unite to protect freedom and the ability for this country to work as intended, evolve over time while leaving in place the mechanisms to quash tyranny and preserve freedom and individualism. They divide us because when apart we are weak, when united we can never be overran from the inside out. They divide us between black and white, men and women, rich and poor, coastal and central. They call 80% of our continental land mass ""flyover"" states or claim our urban centers are communist cesspools of drugs and violence. Anything to keep us eyeing each other with suspicion and tearing each other down instead of suspecting our politicians, business and social leaders, and tearing down those who put themselves before the country andit's people.
We dont have to agree, but we damn sure need to be able to have a conversation. Without this, all will be lost. There's a reason why the 1st and 2nd amendment are constantly under threat. If we lose either one, we lose the country.",2020-07-05T18:55:01Z

When you have white kids ridding their bikes around a affluent neighborhood calling each other the N word, that’s just sick. When you have Asians being perceived as dirty, that’s just pure ignorance. When you perceive LGBTQ relationships as sinful, that’s when you should rethink religion.

These three words officially confirmed for me what I had feared for a long time: the Left has officially arrived in Hell. Their evil won't be hidden anywhere. The hatred they have for anything American is bone chilling and it's time those who desire to live a life of faith, freedom, and peace stand together and say ""we won't back down anymore."" Firstly, the education system needs a thorough look-in because our nation's next generation are being taught to hate the fact they're born here. They're being taught to believe that religious freedom, personal freedom, and the pursuit of happiness are wrong. They're taught to destroy anything that is a monument to the victories of our nation.

They're putting a label on the men who created the foundation of America in hopes people will destroy them.

2020-07-05T18:03:55Z,@DrDRE4391,mXD4zPY4Ai0,"I was a Republican for many years. Bush #2 changed that for me. 

I still espouse most Republican ideals: 

High moral values - I still feel LGBTQs should keep their dealings away from societies view for our children’s sake. 

Freedom to bear arms to an extent as there should be restrictions – as there are now [keeping guns from felons, mentally handicapped, etc…], but thorough background checks are only prudent to do. There has sort of been registrations since the late 60s as you have to fill out a Form 4473 when you buy a new gun. Gun confiscations have occurred during hurricane Katrina and will occur again if Marshall Law is declared. 

Capitalism, except what we have is not what most people think of as Capitalism. We have “crony Capitalism”, bought by money. I used to like being on the side of those that made big money as I wanted to associate myself with the big players. Then I realized that most of what Republicans pass is for those big players, not, small business owners or “workers”. Don’t get me wrong, I’m retired now and doing quite well. I know enough to know that most Republican voters are hurting themselves economically by voting for what the Republicans want. Economically, for most Americans, voting Republican is hurting them. 

Every time a Republican becomes president the country loses. 
Nixon – Liar, Cheater, quit due to certain impeachment. 
Reagan – He ran on the National Debt being too high. He said a trillion dollars would be a stack of one thousand dollar bills nearly 67 miles high. It was 738 billion when he began. It was 2.1 trillion when he left. And those are 1989 dollars. 
Bush 1 – “Read my lips, no new taxes”. Then, he raised taxes. Liar. He also prosecuted the War in the Middle East. 
Bush 2 – “Weapons of mass destruction” as excuse for another War in the Middle East. He also almost lead to the destruction of the world-wide banking system by eliminating banking regulations. 
trump – Well, you know. 

Over time I have come to view Republicans as: 

Liars, Cheaters, Deceivers (Much more so than Democrats) 

Heartless, Uncaring 

Predatorially Capitalistic 

Greedy, Selfish 

Racist, Xenophobic 

A Good Portion Being Uneducated (more college educated are Dems), Stupid, Unknowledgeable, Easily Fooled, “Red-Necks” 

Rigid, Inflexible, Unable to Adapt, Unwilling to Adapt 

Environmentally Ignorant, Scientifically Blind by Choice 

Faux (Fox) News, trump (his name doesn’t deserve or warrant being capitalized) and Republicans pushed for the early opening of the economy prior to scientifically recommended guidelines and are responsible for tens of thousands of deaths, and many more to come. They are murderers and there should be a class-action law suit against them. 

The Republicans in Congress did not prove trump innocent during the impeachment trial, but by opposing new witnesses, proved his guilt. They didn’t do what they should have done in seeking the truth because they knew additional witnesses would prove trump guilty, and that would be a fatal blow to their party. Morally, they are all defunct by what they did. See my list above. 

I will no longer vote Republican as they are morally corrupt. I would vote for Mitt Romney. He was guided by his high moral values and is an upright man. 

Here are questions I wish Republicans would answer. 

1. Republicans show their alliance to trump by prematurely opening up businesses and not wearing masks. Due to that the fact that CV numbers are spiking having done so, has the Republican response to the Corona Virus been the best one? 

2. Republicans want totally free gun control as they are afraid any crack in the gun ban defiance is the path to gun registration and confiscation. Do you think the Republican response concerning guns is the best response for America? 

3. The difference between the parties is America’s # 1 weakness and the rest of the world is taking note. The House side of Congress has submitted more than 300 Bills to Mitch McConnell who has not pursued or discussed them. Yet, the Republicans call the Democrats “do nothing”. Is the Republican stance and the stark separation between the parties making the US stronger? 

4. What is the Republican response against climate change? What is the science that supports their stance? 

5. Republicans support racism. Is it the best stance for Republicans and the US to support racism? 

6. Faux (Fox) News is always bringing up the Communism and Socialism scare. I have not heard any of the other news channels say they promote Communism or Socialism. They just have not said they promote them. Why in your mind does Faux keep bringing them up? 

7. Republicans are against government. Explain to me why so, and what each explanation you give as to how it better’s the US to do so. 

8. Why do Republicans keep voting to give the rich the economic advantages? Why do they still believe in “trickle down” economics?",2020-07-05T18:03:55Z

Racism is in his very DNA--  and he works to expand the vitriol, calling protesters and those working to eradicate racism ""radicals and Marxists"" and branding the very word liberal as a pejorative,  saying that there is a ""merciless campaign to eradicate our history.""  stirring up conspiracy theories punctuated with threats of violence and punitive actions against those exercising their right of free speech, right to dissent, right to protest.  This is inflammatory bullshit with no purpose but to stir up animus.  It would be one thing if it were just a pompous blowhard blowing off steam.

In the time of COVID 19 he holds a Hitler-like rally at a National Monument  ignoring all guidelines for protocols to keep the virus from spreading.  And because it was a ""national event"" and not a campaign event, we the people paid for it.  Shameful!!

2020-07-05T17:40:40Z,@ladyblackburn,mXD4zPY4Ai0,"You want a cure for Covid-19?
My name is Brian C. Procter MD and I am a Board-Certified Family Physician in McKinney, Texas. I am a colleague of Dr. Ivette Lozano that you interviewed a few weeks ago. 

I understand that you are trying to get the truth out about hydroxychloroquine. 
I respectfully suggest that there is a much bigger issue/story here. 

Most commentators are discussing inpatient treatment only. If patients are admitted to the ICU then their chances of survival are dismal. But what happens when we treat patients 3-6 weeks earlier, when they first develop symptoms? 

I have been treating COVID-19 patients in the outpatient trenches for over 2 months now just like Dr. Lozano. I like her, I am using Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, losartan, aspirin, and zinc (all for less than $50 at my local pharmacy). We have identified, diagnosed, and successfully treated these patients at a relatively early point in the course of the disease.

It is these statistics that are amazing. I have treated over 50 patients without a single death, ventilator, or hospitalization. Dr. Lozano has treated twice that many with the same success. I even treated one patient that was discharged from a hospital the day before who was treated with IV fluids only for 4 days and released, still feeling terrible! We are two community docs using EARLY AGGRESSIVE OUTPATIENT TREATMENT to handle the disease with a 100% success rate (ZERO Admissions, ZERO).
Therefore, If we can treat patients EARLY for $50, we seem to be successful at preventing hospitalizations, ICUs, and death as well as saving tens of thousands of healthcare dollars per sick patient. 

My local ICU doctors have pleaded with me to keep doing what I am doing. The answer seems to be EARLY AGGRESSIVE OUTPATIENT TREATMENT and NOT contact tracing (which is communism and ! cannot even get the Public Health Dept on the phone), quarantine (which destroys millions of lives), wearing masks (which is ridiculous as a long term solution w/o proven data), a vaccine (by the time we get it, likely won't need it), social distancing (which won't sustain or GDP with 25% occupancy), testing (ALL tests have a high false negative rate up around 20-30%), or watchful waiting (a tactic that has needlessly resulted in 100,000 deaths). 
We could also place all Nursing home patients on HCQ prophylaxis for 180 days on a voluntary basis of course. 

This could theoretically prevent thousands of needless hospitalizations and deaths. 
In conclusion, if we treat COVID-19 just like anything else we treat (ie, the flu, pneumonia, a sinus infection, hypertension, and diabetes) early and aggressively with a regimen that costs $50 out of pocket or less with 100% success (which is a far better stat than treating all those other conditions), then why is the country shut down and doing social distancing? This political sham must stop.

The American people deserve to know they can go to their regular doctor and get treated early with a regimen that is completely safe and extremely effective, and they do not need to worry about ending up in the hospital and dying. The public is UNAWARE of this, please educate them with the truth. The country needs to return to normal NOW. 

This is the REAL story. Please feel free to contact me with questions. My heart goes out to all those who have needlessly suffered and continue to suffer during this sham crisis and a disease that is extremely treatable if treated EARLY!!! 
BRIAN C. PROCTER MD

Edit: For those who keep asking, no there's nothing wrong with Australia. I love Australia and always will, it's just the gun laws over here suck and there's a bit too much government over reach. For me, somewhere like Texas would suit me better.
It's also not just what the USA can do for me but what I can do for the USA. I think she needs as many good people there as possible, particularly right now, to help with all the challenges. COVID and all the domestic terrorists groups, like ANTIFA and BLM are causing a lot of destruction and it poses a threat to the USA. If the USA falls, so does the rest of the western world. The USA is on the front line of a culture war so I'd like to help contribute in any way I can to preserving the traditions and values that not only make the USA great, but are echoed throughout the western world. I would return to Australia and fight for her if Australia and China ever go to war though.",2020-07-09T16:03:26Z

Wrong, Donald.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT0qNAYJQWU 
The Declaration of Independence was not signed July 4th, dude; it was passed by an advisory Congress to be proposed to the States for their individual ratification, which then, via their delegates, throughout the months of July and August, was ratified by the States. History, Donald. Learn it.
""All men are created equal...""
Yyyeah, don't use the Far Left's selective arguments: say the whole passage.
 ""that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.""
A *whole* lot of carnage and conspiracy has been waged in the name of ""equality"" full stop, and it needs to stop, and it can if we stop repeating the lie and start repeating, often and loudly, the *entire* argument behind the Great Experiment.",2020-07-05T17:05:16Z

Unfortunately the Republicans are an aging shrinking party. The Democrats are growing and there's no stopping them.

Then declare himself “your President of Law and Order” over a peaceful protest which is a tenant of American freedom of speech, is the very start of a police state controlled by a dictatorship. His speech is very contradictory to the leadership he has provided the American people over the years. What lies and manipulations he promotes to confuse his supporters when in fact he is the radical left. Many thousands of deaths could’ve been prevented had he acted sooner during the early stages of the pandemic. He did nothing but leave the American people vulnerable.

He's not dumb nor is he a racist, he's only providing the discourse of a divisive world and eventually, all nation-states will be further fragmented into small states (Kantian), independent, homogeneous, and self-sufficient (Sustainable Development)... Democracy from the ground up (Rousseau)... The Liberal International Order (Ikenberry) is quietly being dismantled as it's relevancy is now in question under the UN SDG framework.  The US hegemony is no longer needed; a fully integrated world with the Internet at the core of this unification is a must; we no longer need the nation-state; we no longer need a world drowning in self-interest and longing for more freedom.  We all need to be more responsible, we need a new ethic that is inclusive of all things on our planet... It's a shame that some people actually believe that they have the right and the justification to exploit the world just because the economics are sound.  I do not condone socialism nor do I support all things environmental, what I do support is control of the production-consumption, to make more with less resources, to expand science and technology...

I figured even if Trump was a complete flop, the nation would survive.  I was cautiously optimistic that he might do passably well, but I wasn't hoping for much.

In 2020 I'm voting for the best leader this nation could hope for against this rising tide of radical Marxism and useful idiots.  Don't believe the media or the polls, American's LOVE Trump and for good reason.  While the media tries to divide us along racial lines, Trump brought back jobs, removed troops from the Middle East, backed our allies, called out our enemies, and all without getting us involved in another overseas war _and_ with an openly hostile media and opposing political party.

Perhaps most amazing of all, after almost 4 years in the most stressful office in the country, he's still looking strong and has amazing energy.  I remember Bush, Clinton, and Obama didn't look so good at this point.",2020-07-05T13:20:27Z

The gop coverup failed knowing that Leningrad Lindsey and Moscow Mitch we’re doing the assist 

So here’s a very serious thought 

We are at a cross road and it’s looking very dangerous

It’s impossible I believe that before Pinocchio got into office Putin was decades away from developing a supersonic weapon system by aug of 2018 Putin boasted of having such a system coincidence

Here’s the way I see what has been happening in just the few months 

Pinocchio is already moving to subvert the nation with his stoking tweets on white power 

The very same play out of putins playbook

Putin did the very same thing in Georgia Maldova and the Ukraine 

I wouldn’t put it past him to know there are Russian subversive already in country insighting supremacist militants 

Pinocchio has his back up against a wall and like all animals when they have their back trapped they will do anything

Remaining silent about Putin bounty on American soldiers is beyond understanding while asking the G7 to allow Russia back into the group

Pinocchio has never attacked putin over anything he’s gone to lengths to attack our intelligence agencies while touting Putin now he’s moving to take our troops out of Europe and has made  statements about pulling us out of NATO

Pinocchio knew about the bounty as far back as Feb 2019 the anniversary day where better than 500 Russian mercenaries attacked US troops in the northeastern part of syria where 300 russian mercenaries died Putin order the GRU to target US troops anywhere not just Afghanistan 

All the while Barr moved to silence the SDNY

Just to many tells 

Get real it’s real

Moscow Mitch and Leningrad Lindsey are by all intentions moving to coverup 

While Barr and Trump start making false accusations about voter fraud this has all the ear marks of a coup in the making 

Furthermore trump already threatened to move the military against citizens the tells get deeper and deeper 

Add to this they know the polls have them losing the presidential election and the senate which will mean democrats will investigate all their crimes  

I haven’t even covered the pandemic at hand which has killed more than 150 thousand citizens and forecast to infect more than 100 thousand a day if not for what must certainly and hopefully must be incompetence Pinocchio has failed Americans 

Calling everything he’s been guilty of a hoax I believe he thinks is appropriate

Mr. President, do you know something we should know? How can you stop the situation with protestors, looters and unacceptable behavior? Take care of one important issue. Stop being a fraidy cat and threatening the military. Adjust the laws nationwide to PROTECT the citizens ...all American citizens from Police Brutality.

The greatest Americans that ever lived are buried in military cemeteries, because they made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom, and it seems every president, besides you, has at least considered that fact “commoners” actually defend this country, for more than a bank note. Secondly, the Mt. Rushmore presidential depiction will most certainly not last forever. That’s not how “time” and natural forces of erosion work. Your fossil fuel buddies that you take money from can explain acid rain to you in a coloring book!        And you can’t call it “desecration” if you steal an entire race of peoples holiest land during a genocide, and build a monument that mocks them on it, and then they, and any American with a soul asks nonviolently to take it down. I’m proud on this day to celebrate the birth of democracy, and free speech. And my right as a tax paying American to say fk you lil donnie! And I can’t wait until this fledgling country is truly GREAT for this first time. I love you American people! Yes even the ones that drank trumps koolade. They will come around when the smog lifts, or by raising kids, that are so bewildered and embarrassed by their nonsense, those young folks will bond together and demand transparency, respect and empathy from those in the great White Castle.

李辉林评论：这有我十几年前就发出的“总书记支持伪科学”打压科学真理重要、影响与后果还严重吗？
But for both Democrats and Republicans in the United States, ""power is truth"" over China for nearly a century for thousands of years.No matter who you are, whether you are a ruling bandit or a cultural swindler, if you succeed in gaining power or being recognized by the regime, it is repeat one's mistakes to judge the core cultural values that can win everything.Yang Zhenning, for example, was born in the Republic of China and grew up in the Republic of China.Young people began to receive European and American western science and democracy education for more than 60 years (foster mother).Finally, the Chinese Communist Party (stepmother) chose to turn to the restoration of the feudal Confucian ruling cultural system, which it believed had the real power to constantly surpass the United States and Western civilization.Of course, the Hong Kong society, with the surface of upper western civilization and the essence of Chinese traditional culture, is the universality of its rights and interests.Without an objective, fair and equal awareness, it is impossible to treat the public fairly, and there will be no basis for the general support of society.Those at home and abroad who, by making lies and attributing blame to the people's despotic feudal bigwigs and cultural flunks, try their best to beautify the feudal robbers who maintain the feudal bigwigs and cultural flunks to rule the despotic people in the cultural system.The so-called ""democratic"" personages who want to overthrow the ""autocracy"" are actually no different in nature from the feudal autocracy.Jiang Jingguo's ""ending autocracy with autocracy"" is not the ""Chinese historical, civilized and progressive revolution"" led by Chinese literati.

李辉林评论：但不论是美国的民主党还是共和党，近一个世纪来对中国几千年的“权力就是真理”。不管什么人、做统治强盗还是做文化骗子，成功获得政权或得到政权地认可，就能赢得一切的核心文化价值观地判断是一错再错的。还是举杨振宁为例：生于民国长于民国（亲娘），从小饱读四书五经。青年开始接受欧美西方科学民主教育60多年（养母）。最后却是选择投靠复辟封建儒教统治文化体制，认为其具有不断赶超美国与西方文明的实（权）力的中共（后妈）。当然以表面上层西方文明，民俗实质中国传统文化习惯的香港社会，就是其视权视利地普遍性了。没有客观、公正、平等地认识意识，就不可能公平地对待社会民众，也就得不到社会普遍支撑地基础。海内外那些靠制造谎言嫁祸为人民专制封建权贵和文化奴才的人，极力美化维护封建权贵和文化奴才统治文化制度专制人民的封建强盗。要推翻“专制”的所谓“民主”人士，其实性质与封建专制没有什么不同。蒋经国的“用专制结束专制”，才不是中国文人主导的“中国历史文明进步地革命”。
（有人控制不让我给你“回复”。）
The general Secretary actually proposed to the whole ruling system: ""the social development view in harmony with pseudoscience"" (the coup of the chief designer used the hidden rules to rule the whole China;The General Secretary publicly promotes the ""unspoken rule ruling system"";Are they violating the constitution of the People's Republic of China?Or do you personally explain the ""nature of the CPC Constitution"" in this way?)In addition, the pseudoscience elites from both east and west have been firmly and actively cooperating and responding for a long time, jointly blocking my domestic and international web pages, email addresses and cloud disk, and restricting and tampering with my online comments.These are the facts of my public and objective experience, and I have the responsibility to uphold the truth of the law.The Chinese Communist Party dare not shoulder its ""unspoken law enforcement responsibility""!Because I am not good English, network translation is not at ease.So the important questions are all in Chinese.
李辉林评论：中共邪恶潜规则强盗统治身份制度，总书记竟然向整个统治体制提出了：“与伪科学和谐的社会发展观”（总设计师政变用潜规则统治贪污霸占整个中国；总书记公开推行“潜规则统治制度”；他们是违反“中华人民共和国宪法”？还是亲自在如此权释其“中共宪法本质”？）并得到了东西方社会伪科学精英们地长期坚决积极配合响应，共同封杀我的国内国际网页、邮箱、云盘，限制并篡改我的网上评论。这些都是我公开的客观经历事实，我能承担维护法律真实的责任。中共却不敢承担其“潜规则执法责任”！（因为本人英语不行，对网络翻译又不放心。所以重要问题都是用中文表述。）
The ruling cultural elites have jointly created a top hypocritical cultural elite, Yang Zhenning, who has destroyed human civilization. The false science, culture and knowledge have cheated the whole world, polluted the chaos, and of course become the ""clothes of beasts"" for human beings only to make appearances.For a long time ""cosmic objective truth"" has been on the earth, it is not known that the energy of its truth can restore the true understanding of nature and the real understanding of human public civilization.It must be connivance or for the human bandits, cheats, hooligans, scoundrels can rule the human society of cultural theory.
人类统治文化精英们共同打造了一个最顶级虚伪的文化精英杨振宁，已经将人类文明颠覆糟蹋，虚假的科学、文化、知识将全世界欺骗污染混乱，不能真实公平讲理当然地就成为了人类只为表面做样子“禽兽的衣冠”。在“宇宙客观真理”已经来到人间之长时间，还不知道使其真理的能量还原真实的认识大自然和真实的人间公共文明认识。必然是在纵容或为人类的强盗、骗子、流氓、无赖能够统治人类社会地文化理论造势。
The human civilization and the earth civilization are still in the ignorant state, the feudal bandit culture and the liar rule the human civilization state, so they will talk about the ""cosmic civilization"" and rate it?Just like the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China's ""social development concept in harmony with pseudoscience"";Yang Zhenning plagiarized ""cosmic objective truth"" and completely denied ""Newton and Einstein were all wrong"" the Communist Party of China ""cosmic civilization standard""?The science of his deception is not high, but he has been able to eat China and the United States for more than half a century and even the whole world. He is the founder, general adviser and matchmaker of the ""Thousand Talents Plan"".If Yang Zhenning is not a Chinese spy, he must be an American spy. Can't he be a double agent?The two countries and the political differences or opposing parties, the school of science and culture to him are still such a taboo!
李辉林评论：人类对人类文明、地球文明都还是处在懵懵懂懂，封建强盗文化骗子统治人类的文明状态，就去妄论“宇宙文明”并为其评级？就如中共总书记的“与伪科学和谐的社会发展观”；杨振宁剽窃“宇宙客观真理”全盘否定“牛顿与爱因斯坦都错得离谱”地中共“宇宙文明标准”？其骗术的科学含金量并不高，却能通过吃中美两国半个多世纪甚至全球，是当之无愧“千人计划”的鼻祖、总顾问、牵线搭桥人。杨振宁不肯定是中国间谍，就必然是美国间谍，不可能是两面间谍吧？两国及各政见不同或对立党派、科学文化学派对他都还如此地投鼠忌器！",2020-07-05T04:27:24Z

They are obsessed with suppressing our sense of the possible - one of the ways they accomplish this is by restricting our access to correct information. They are hoarding knowledge of TRUE history, TRUE geology, TRUE astronomy, TRUE health, TRUE physics, etc. and, most importantly of all, knowledge of the TRUE nature of 'reality' itself while teaching a false, incomplete and distorted version of those subjects to the general public, who usually unquestioningly accept all of it. To anyone who dismisses anything that I post as being 'crazy', just remember that all it takes to suppress a person's sense of the possible is to restrict his or her access to correct information. Simple as that. Don't let others dictate to you what can and 'cannot' be done, what is 'real' and 'unreal' and what is possible and 'impossible'. You can do ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO and you can be ANYONE YOU WANT TO BE, while still facing the karmic consequences of your actions. People are AWAKENING to a MORE EXPANDED CONCEPTION of the world and life in general and this is a PROFOUNDLY GOOD THING. We owe it to our innate intelligence to QUESTION EVERYTHING and that includes EVERYTHING that I tell you. There are two things that they do not want you to know above all else:

1. That who and what we ALL really are is Pure Consciousness, which is INFINITE AND ETERNAL, experiencing life in a temporary human form (you can call Pure Consciousness 'God' if you want, but I don't, because the word 'God' has limiting religious connotations that I would rather avoid).

2. That what we call 'reality' is ILLUSORY and therefore MALLEABLE, which means that NOTHING is impossible (indeed, even the word 'impossible' itself literally says ""I'm possible!"").

The righteous will inherit the Earth and beyond, other mes. Have faith in that. And sharpen your swords until that day comes. We have the power to transform this prison illusion into a PARADISE ILLUSION, so let's USE that power! 😎",2020-07-05T04:17:51Z

Please mlk said you cant fight darknesss with dark eness you must use light and u cant fight hate with hate you must use love. But this terrorist group is fighting love or peace with hate. Please tou dishonor mlk and the people white and black that have fought and died for our rights and that created our new country were racism isnt holding us back. I am 49 and we only get better every generation u are making that not true this generation. God bless you all,2020-07-05T03:59:36Z

2020-07-05T03:35:34Z,@andrewherman2370,mXD4zPY4Ai0,"I think it's strange how White guys can just declare a White guy who made a difference hundreds of years ago, even though they did despicable things (owned and sold and raped slaves) can and will never be forgotten or abandoned. But when Black people want to talk about their struggles and their leaders from Civil Right movements the resounding chorus of White Folks is ""get over it."" Speaking of ""cancel culture"", why do Black Americans have to cancel their history?
So you can and will never get over Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt, but if Black people want to fight for their own American dream and remember the struggles against the founding father's slavery errors, then they need to forget and shut up? Is this White Privilege? White guy history is the truth in full without apology. Black guy history was never important so shut up already?

This makes America look UNJUST. The more Trump speaks the less great America becomes. America is great only as much as it is good. Defending The Confederate Symbols of racism is not good. The idiot rioters who tore down Union Soldiers monuments  had no idea what they were doing. Trump is playing both sides here. He wants to crush Black protests for removal of Confederate monuments AND claim The Civil Rights Movement was sacred. This is not consistent. This is a man with a forked tongue speaking.",2020-07-05T03:35:34Z

It stands for ""a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader and forcible suppression of opposition."" .....That is not a far left position. Furthermore, that accusation is right out of his playbook to accuse others of what he is guilty of... Let's be VERY CLEAR about this dangerous development.

He was elected to be the president of all Americans. He is talking to his ""loyal"" base. Nothing about  the pandemic which is worse here than just about anywhere else on earth. Other countries now have travel restrictions to keep us out. I guess he thinks it will go away and help his ""numbers"" if he just ignores it. 

Nothing of substance about healing the injustices still suffered by Black Americans (he's supposed to be the president of the *United States*), except implying that protesters are a menace instead of overwhelmingly peaceful Americans exercising their right rights when America is not fulfilling its promise. There's nothing more American than our right to do that.

Why does he use his platform to divide us and try to deepen our resentments toward each other? Well, he thinks it will get him re-elected. As he might say, it's ""sad."" This is clearly scripted, based on the very stilted reading. You'd think with that foresight, his people would steer him in a more presidential direction, one that addresses all Americans.

Flu test with Negative results with patients continuously told it was a restrained flu and antibiotics weren't curing respiratory illnesses?  Were Folks written off as pneumonia and flu when they died?  Aren't Nursing homes notorious for these ""easy write offs"" in medical charts?.  Is it because Folks are just now getting tested that's why it has catapulted?  If all folks were tested (like we did for c19) for TB and AIDS and Sx Transmitted diseases  it would show a skyrocketed pandemic as well --right?  Was this the C19 ""chosen"" one to be  catapulted by the dems?  Before the election?  We need audits and stats on all nursing homes and hospitals on death reasons and let's just see how many were written off as flu (even if tested negative and written as flu) or pneumonia and research how patients were treated and the testing results -- especially govt hospitals that get grant reimbursements..  We should all sue the ones really responsible in this country for catapulting this hoax that may have been around since 2011?   Yes there may be a c19, but if it has been around since then, the risks would be the same now as it was then.   MSM and dems caused fear, caused us to lose our retirement money, lost jobs, and caused another cultural social behavior to enter our society..a change that would isolate humans and to create a perfect environment to pull the Marxist rioters out of their hats like rabid rabbits.

2020-07-05T01:26:21Z,@186kmilespersecond,mXD4zPY4Ai0,"This is A STONE COLD PRESIDENT!
You sound like a war monger. Not building peace within these borders. But an US VERSUS THEM.
Justice for all, is not happening with a police force that is enabled to bully people, choke and shoot their rights away. With no consequence, with a wall of a union that fights, not for justice, but for the police. Immunity to laws. THAT ISN'T RIGHT! WE CALL FOR A CHANGE! 
Forward! 
A young activists, a patriot, tries to right America from it's errors, tearing down a statue revering a man who harmed the innocent, arrogantly owned other human beings, and whose statue was erected for the express purpose of intimidating those he thought deserving of enslavement. That statue deserved no reverence! it only empowered those who wanted to intimidate and degrade their victims. And a brave, young person stands and says, NO! The document we love, the document of the PROMISE, said this is wrong!
That document also warned of tyranny infiltrating our beloved country. These young people are only seeking justice for all, as promised in that document. Just as the Boston tea party Patriots, refused to bow to tyrrany, so too did these young people,
How dare you lock them up 10 years! All while your evil Co conspirators in the Whitehouse are let out of jail. All while Bill Barr takes over our justice department and removes all justice. He tries to place lackeys in positions that protect the president from the people knowing truth about him.
==Meanwhile, as he threatens immigrants, young people who have lived here their whole life, with nowhere else to go, he builds walls to tell our neighbors STAY OUT! 
Not kindly. Hatefully. ""We don't want you,"" says our president. ""You are rapists.""
You've alienated all our allies, and befriended dictators.
This isn't a president who should place himself next to these great predecessors, while he is refusing to sacrifice for his countrymen, he puts money and power first. He leaves us all to fight the virus without a federal government. DURING A PANDEMIC!
THERE YOU ARE! HAVING A DANGEROUS CROWD TOGETHER WITHOUT DISTANCING OR MASKS, These are not what these great men represent, that you think you are like by standing next to their statues! It doesn't work that way! You have to actually care about us! And this party with no masks, shows yet again, you don't.

It's all about you.

We lose our health.
We lose our allies as you serve Putin and destroy our global relationships. Even the WHO, you've booted.

Lastly, lady liberty condemns this President with her words, as he pontificates his warlord aura. He shouts LAW AND ORDER, but refuses to live by our laws.
He fires anyone who gets in his way.

A small group of extremists, he declares representative of all who aren't with him. He declares himself against half of his own, peace loving people. There is no justice. Just thoughtless, knee-jerk reaction, even bringing our military against us, as we peacefully protest. Guilty because he says so. The founding fathers called King George a tyrant for that.
Why is he quoting a tyrant, by the way, who is responsible for many deaths in our country? Who cares what the tyrant King George says about George Washington? 

He stands up there, not uniting his people as we face this terrible threat to life with this virus, no, he threatens and riles up half of us against the other half.
We are different. But we're not anarchists. We love that document, the Constitution, and it's promise to all. Equality. Life. Liberty. We weren't intended to be left in stone, stuck in monuments of the past. We love and honor those good men. But they aren't there in these statues. They live in our hearts! We were intended to be a moving forward society. Putting out the fire of tyranny wherever it arose. 

Even if it arose in a statue.

These young protesters, trying to put down wrongfully erected tyrants, traitors, murderers, revered in statues, though they may be misguided in some of their methods, are absolutely true to this country's moral compass. THE YOUNG PATRIOT WOULD RISK ALL FOR THE CAUSE OF EQUALITY!
DO NOT IMPRISON THEM 10 YEARS! WHAT A TRAVESTY OF INJUSTICE! . 
Is that a deserving sentence, or the sentence of a dictator who forgot that this government wasn't created by the people for HIM.
WE, THE GOVERNED, ARE SUPPOSED TO GOVERN THOSE WHO WE ALLOW TO GOVERN US. WE DECLARE YOU UNFIT TO GOVERN. WE DECLARE THIS SENTENCE UNJUST!
THESE BOLD, BRAVE, ACTIVISTS MEANT WELL! THEY ARE WHAT OUR COUNTRY WAS MADE OF. THE BOSTON TEA PARTY WAS MADE OF YOUNG PEOPLE JUST LIKE THEM!
LAW AND ORDER IS NOTHING BUT DICTATORSHIP, IF IT ISN'T TEMPERED BY MERCY AND TRUE JUSTICE, RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. 
Will that there be men who treat you with this same mercilessness! For your day of reckoning will come. You've done far worse than tear down the Statue of a traitor to our country.
You know you have.
Lastly, Lady Liberty condemns you, and your wall, and your bullying out children America raised, and have nowhere else to call home. You delight in the fear in which you make them live! 
May God see your unjust ways, your tearing up of that promise of that blessed document! He sees you! And so does Lady Liberty: Her words:
""Give me your tired, your poor
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore
Send these the homeless tempest-tost to me
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!""
YOU'VE SLAMMED THAT DOOR IN THEIR FACES! THEIR TEARS CRY OUT TO GOD DAY AND NIGHT AGAINST YOU! you can pretend to be patriotic all you want, but it's a lie!",2020-07-05T01:32:59Z

Removing  monuments of divisive oppressors does not erase history. That is why we have history books and an education system.  Removing these divisive monuments simply acknowledges that we no longer celebrate and honor the abhorrent agenda that these monuments represent.  In Germany today, you will not find statues honoring Hitler. You will not find  displays of of Swastikas on public buildings. Germany has evolved and yet their history remains.  I am a proud American. Thomas Jefferson said,""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.""  -  Eloquent words mean nothing when scripted into history if they are not acted upon. It is time we start treating our neighbors, our fellow American's of color as equals, with the same love and passion that our Creator intended.  There is nothing proud about celebrating confederate symbols that represent opposition to the freedom and equality of non-white Americans.",2020-07-05T01:13:51Z

Hear me! I need your strength and wisdom.
Let me walk in beauty, and make my eyes
ever hold the red and purple sunset.
Make my hands respect the things you have made
and my ears sharp to hear your voice.
Make me wise so that I may understand
the things you have taught my people.
Let me learn the lessons you have hidden
in every leaf and rock.

Help me remain calm and strong in the
face of all that comes towards me.
Help me find compassion without
empathy overwhelming me.
I seek strength, not to be greater than my brother,
but to fight my greatest enemy: myself.
Make me always ready to come to you
with clean hands and straight eyes.
So when life fades, as the fading sunset,
my spirit may come to you without shame.

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.

The Beneficent ﴾1﴿  Hath made known the Qur'an. ﴾2﴿  He hath created man. ﴾3﴿  He hath taught him utterance. ﴾4﴿  The sun and the moon are made punctual. ﴾5﴿  The stars and the trees prostrate. ﴾6﴿  And the sky He hath uplifted; and He hath set the measure, ﴾7﴿  That ye exceed not the measure, ﴾8﴿  But observe the measure strictly, nor fall short thereof. ﴾9﴿  And the earth hath He appointed for (His) creatures, ﴾10﴿  Wherein are fruit and sheathed palm-trees, ﴾11﴿  Husked grain and scented herb. ﴾12﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾13﴿  He created man of clay like the potter's, ﴾14﴿  And the jinn did He create of smokeless fire. ﴾15﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾16﴿  Lord of the two Easts, and Lord of the two Wests! ﴾17﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾18﴿  He hath loosed the two seas. They meet. ﴾19﴿  There is a barrier between them. They encroach not (one upon the other). ﴾20﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾21﴿  There cometh forth from both of them the pearl and coral-stone. ﴾22﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾23﴿  His are the ships displayed upon the sea, like banners. ﴾24﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾25﴿  Everyone that is thereon will pass away; ﴾26﴿  There remaineth but the Countenance of thy Lord of Might and Glory. ﴾27﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾28﴿  All that are in the heavens and the earth entreat Him. Every day He exerciseth (universal) power. ﴾29﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾30﴿  We shall dispose of you, O ye two dependents (man and jinn). ﴾31﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾32﴿  O company of jinn and men, if ye have power to penetrate (all) regions of the heavens and the earth, then penetrate (them)! Ye will never penetrate them save with (Our) sanction. ﴾33﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾34﴿  There will be sent, against you both, heat of fire and flash of brass, and ye will not escape. ﴾35﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾36﴿  And when the heaven splitteth asunder and becometh rosy like red hide - ﴾37﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? - ﴾38﴿  On that day neither man nor jinni will be questioned of his sin. ﴾39﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾40﴿  The guilty will be known by their marks, and will be taken by the forelocks and the feet. ﴾41﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾42﴿  This is hell which the guilty deny. ﴾43﴿  They go circling round between it and fierce, boiling water. ﴾44﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾45﴿  But for him who feareth the standing before his Lord there are two gardens. ﴾46﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾47﴿  Of spreading branches. ﴾48﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾49﴿  Wherein are two fountains flowing. ﴾50﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾51﴿  Wherein is every kind of fruit in pairs. ﴾52﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾53﴿  Reclining upon couches lined with silk brocade, the fruit of both the gardens near to hand. ﴾54﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾55﴿  Therein are those of modest gaze, whom neither man nor jinni will have touched before them. ﴾56﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾57﴿  (In beauty) like the jacynth and the coral-stone. ﴾58﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾59﴿  Is the reward of goodness aught save goodness? ﴾60﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾61﴿  And beside them are two other gardens, ﴾62﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾63﴿  Dark green with foliage. ﴾64﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾65﴿  Wherein are two abundant springs. ﴾66﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾67﴿  Wherein is fruit, the date-palm and pomegranate. ﴾68﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾69﴿  Wherein (are found) the good and beautiful - ﴾70﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? - ﴾71﴿  Fair ones, close-guarded in pavilions - ﴾72﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? - ﴾73﴿  Whom neither man nor jinni will have touched before them - ﴾74﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾75﴿  Reclining on green cushions and fair carpets. ﴾76﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾77﴿  Blessed be the name of thy Lord, Mighty and glorious! ﴾78﴿",2020-07-05T00:16:37Z

The founding fathers fought so that their voices could be heard. They felt like they weren’t heard and Britain was unwilling to bend. (No taxation without representation). They risked their lives for freedom. 
Many presidents did horrible things in order to further America’s standing in the world. Jackson and his trail of tears to take over Native American territory that was given to them by Jefferson is one example of atrocities. It’s sad that many Americans don’t know their history.",2020-07-04T23:38:14Z

Progress yes, changes and corrections were made yes but ignoring the horrific crimes committed against native Americans then Africans is absolutely shocking for me who is neither African nor native, I cannot imagine the anger they feel when the president praises US as near perfect country!!! It is embarrassing and inhuman to make such statements. I am also tired of officials praising military as if they have been going through true wars of defense!! Most of the wars they either started or participated in, are wars of offense and injustice. Praising them for destroying and killing people for what? Self defense!!! Demagogy is so old and so tiring and depressing and it's unfortunately all over the world...people has to wake up, the more aware and educated we are, the more cautious the governments will be. They love docile and not well informed people, that's a key to doing whatever they want..  loving your country involves also being honest about mistakes and injustices inflicted on others..",2020-07-04T22:52:37Z

First he talks about all the past leaders of our Country and then tries to align himself with those leaders. HE’S NOT A GREAT LEADER. He’s corrupt as hell. We all know it. If he cared about justice, he wouldn’t have turned BARR into his own personal guard dog. Trump doesn’t even know what the Constitution says. Protesting is guaranteed in the CONSTITUTION. That is as AMERICAN as it gets. A true Patriot would NEVER have allowed over 130,000 Americans to die from COVID...! In this this speech he ignores those AMERICANS who have DIED...Who are struggling with unemployment...who are struggling to survive. He is trying to use this diversion to convince his WHITE base that Nationalism is the same thing as Patriotism. He is REALLY promoting Nationalism - a racist dog whistle. He is promoting exclusion, “them vs us.” That is proven in his tweets, straight from his own mouth. Not this speech written for him. Those monuments he talks about are to honor confederate heroes - TRAITORS to this nation. What good is this false God, if the people perish?

TRUMP is giving a divisive speech. This is NOT what he should be doing to unite America. He trying to turn conservative American against liberal American by demonizing “Democrats” so he can get elected...and move forward in becoming a dictator. He has abolished all checks and balances, he has abolished the jobs of those people who are supposed to protect us. He should be using language that HEALS.

With Pence as president, Pence can pardon Trump and his family for all federal crimes.  Florida governor DeSantis is a Trump loyalist.  He will never extradite a Florida citizen, Trump, to New York to face various charges of financial fraud.  If Trump can keep the democratic focus off his long term strategy he will be winner.

2020-07-04T21:55:28Z,@DeHirvilammi,mXD4zPY4Ai0,".somethings to ponder... 
Do you really think it’s just a “coincidence” that Jeffrey Epstein abruptly died right before he was going to prison for the rest of his life and would likely need to testify against or expose some of the worlds biggest names in connection with his pedophilic crimes?
Do you really think it’s just a “coincidence” that the pathologist who was hired to do George Floyd’s autopsy was the same pathologist who “observed” and had connections to the autopsy for Jeffrey Epstein?
Do you really think it’s just a “coincidence” that members of the Chinese Communist party were part of the group outside the Whitehouse rioting and causing destruction and most of the rioters and looters in Minneapolis were from out of state?
Do you really think it’s just a “coincidence” that an event guaranteed to spark anger about racial injustice happened at the very moment the unemployment rate in the country was at an all time high because of Coronavirus? Allowing millions who were now without jobs to have the ability to spend their time looting and rioting?
Do you really think it’s just a “coincidence” that random piles of bricks magically appeared in various cities right before riots broke out, while there were no construction sites or possible need for a pile of bricks within miles?
Do you really think it’s just a “coincidence” that scientists discovered the Coronavirus was actually man-made and that it had been doctored to bind to humans? Or that it hardly mutated since it began to infect us which suggests it was already fully adapted to humans?
Do you really think it’s just a “coincidence” that the virus they created which caused a huge pandemic just so happened to be an airborne virus that would make it perfectly acceptable for paid rioters and looters to wear masks and conceal their identity, yet blend in perfectly with the crowd since everyone else is wearing masks too?
Do you really think it’s just a “coincidence” that the media used a picture from an Italian hospital on the news during the COVID pandemic pretending it was a current scene at a hospital in New York........and then apologized publicly and called it a “mistake” and then two months later used a picture off the World War Z movie trailer on the news pretending it was America on fire? Was that also a “mistake”?
Do you really think it’s just a “coincidence” that while the media and news shoved their twisted narrative in our face and focused solely on the riots and looting going on, that we missed the DIRE news that a judge ruled that Hilary Clinton WILL in fact be forced to testify regarding her missing emails? Or that the Senate gave authorization to subpoena over 30 Obama officials in the Obamagate case?
Do you really think it’s just a “coincidence” that all of these terrible things are happening back to back to back to back on an election year?
Because if you do.......think again. This was planned. And we paid the price just like they wanted us to. Innocent and beautiful lives have been taken because of their sick agenda - beautiful black souls, beautiful white souls, beautiful law enforcement souls. HUMAN souls.
WE ARE BEING PLAYED. WAKE UP AND SMELL THE BULLSHIT AMERICA.

We are far more than just a country that has racism. Every country has racism. But not every country can claim to have stopped Hitler and the national socialists. Not every country can claim To have given seminal documents and freedom like the bill of rights for the constitution or invented vaccines or put people on the moon. The USA had lifted hundreds of millions both here and around the world out of poverty. We have helped all over the world anytime there was a crisis. We are not perfect but our flaws are far from the whole story! Thank you for the perspective President Trump!

2020-07-04T20:31:04Z,@deviusfeilds,mXD4zPY4Ai0,"This speach in a few words. 
The British ruled America. The people captured in stone behind him rallied up and over threw the British in a rebellion and then moved the nation foreard. I love the people who established America they are patriotic. I love the country they created. 
Today A new band of outlaws threaten America. They have these crazy ideas like not wanting the corrupt government that is trying to put ridiculous laws for minor infringements to remain. They want peace and liberty for all and those rebels threaten the establishment. They are trying to indoctrinate our kids in the crazy notion that we should move past our history and make America different to what it was. 
We Americans in power need to come down hard on those just like the British tried to in 1776. This rebels are trying to rewrite history, just like those rebels did in 1776. 
I love the President's behind me and what they did. Standing for freedom justice and liberty for all. I will go back to the way that things were in 1776. Conservatism and rule of law. Historic Western values vs the ability to move the country forward. 
Which is exactly what the 4 men behind him did. 
Summary: Trumps logic is so full of holes its ridiculous, save 41:37 of your life and vote him out.",2020-07-04T20:31:04Z

Trump is the most dynamic speaker. He knows what he wants to say, and he says it clearly, passionately, knowingly. He's strong. He's capable in the extreme. I was maybe 20 feet off to his right, and he looks robust, the picture of health. Best of all, when Trump says he loves America and We, the People, he means it. It comes from his heart and shows on his face. Trump is the best president the US has EVER HAD. He's better than Washington, better did Lincoln, because the work he's done has been against domestic enemies in the US House of Representatives, against a Swamp Washington and Lincoln, whatever their challenges, never knew. Yet, he wants four more years, because he loves America!
Thank you, President Trump! Thank you to everyone who voted for Trump in 2016 and to everyone who will vote for him this November.
May Almighty God, Father of Our LORD and Savior Jesus Christ, bless, protect, and defend you, Mr. President! May no plan formed against you prosper, but may those plans backfire upon those who are behind them. As I ask for Your blessing on our great duly elected and totally beloved 45th President of the United States, Donald John Trump, I ask You to remind him, and us, to bless You, too.

2020-09-14T17:11:21Z,@rk6006,5nD2s9dWess,"‼️‼️‼️ I found this interesting. This is an open letter to all Democrats from a Democrat. I did not write this, a friend on FB sent it to me. It needs to be shared...

I just have a few questions for you....Let me start with, I already know you don't like President Trump...that's a given, SO let's move on from that...

How about the division of America....Do you really blame Trump for that?

How about when NONE of the DEMOCRATS showed up for his inauguration? Don't you think that started the division? He hadn't even been president yet, and EXCEPT for Clinton and Obama, not one democrat showed up....Is that when Trump divided America? Can you imagine if the REPUBLICANS didn't show up for Obama's inauguration because they lost??? Can you even start to imagine what would have happened?

How about when 19 minutes after Trump was inaugurated, the Washington Post declared the IMPEACHMENT CAMPAIGN has STARTED? Was that when Trump divided America?

How about when Nancy Pelosi ripped up Trump's state of the union right in front of the world, showing complete disrespect for the President of the United States? Did that bring the country together and is THAT when Trump divided America?

How about when America had to endure, 3 years and over 30 million dollars spent on trying to PROVE that Trump only won because of RUSSIAN COLLUSION and NOT because America voted him in and 17 democrats did EVERYTHING in their power to PROVE that there was Russian Collusion...and came up with ZERO...? Was THAT when Trump divided America?

I can't even start to go over the NEGATIVE PRESS he's received since his surprise win...

Remember, the DONORS, such as Bloomberg, who gave 27 million, Tom Steyer who gave 17 million, George Soros who gave 9 million and MANY MORE that gave MULTI-MILLIONS to Hillary, wanted a return on their investment...
Do you really think that donors give MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS just because they love Hillary?
NO, these weren't campaign donations, they were INVESTMENTS into what HILLARY had promised them when she became president...They were so sure she would win and they would be SHOWERED with HUGE RETURNS, and when it didn't happen and they LOST all those millions, they went all out to TAKE TRUMP out of OFFICE by any means possible...

DID YOU KNOW that 90% of the Mainstream media and the corporations that own them, are owned by or run by BIG DEMOCRAT DONORS? You can verify all of that for yourselves...I did...

Since the moment Trump won, even before he was inaugurated, the mainstream media's reporting was 92% negative on Trump, do you know why?

It was those big donors that lost their dream of MILLIONS of dollars, on their returns that they were going to receive when Hillary was president and they weren't going to take that loss lightly...They needed to PUNISH TRUMP and those that VOTED HIM IN...

I've said this since the night he was elected...
""There is NOTHING the left won't do to take down our President, our country and us, no low they won't go to, to get their power back,"" and sadly, we have seen this every single day since his election.

Let me ask you this...Have you ever listened to Trump or appreciated any accomplishment or campaign promises he's kept, have you ever gone to one of his rallies or have you just closed your mind to ANYTHING he does?

Please ask yourselves the following questions, if you dare...

What has Joe Biden done for America for the last 47 years that he's held an office?

What did Joe Biden ever do for BLACKS when HE and Obama were in office?

What has Joe Biden ever done in his entire life to create a private-sector job?

What has Joe Biden done to help the American middle class worker?

Let me also ask you this...Why do you think there are so many people tearing down statues, burning our flag, beating up police officers, disrespecting our founders and hating our country?

It comes straight from our SCHOOLS that have slowly been tearing down our history...

If there is a teacher out there, please tell me the following:

Do you teach the truth that it was the DEMOCRATS that were the KKK?

That the GRAND LEADER of the KKK was Robert Byrd, who was elected to congress and served for decades, and that it was Hillary, Bill, and Obama that gave his EULOGY praising him?

That the DEMOCRATS fought the Civil war to KEEP SLAVERY?

That the inner-city ghettos were created by DEMOCRATS to keep control of slaves after they were freed?

That planned parenthood was founded in inner cities to CONTROL the BLACK POPULATION?

Is any of this in your history books?

Let me ask you this as well.

Can a student speak up when he/she disagrees with a teacher when they say that Trump is a horrible president or the electoral college has to be eliminated? I don't think so.
Well, I know a student that actually happened to...When the teacher said it had to be eliminated because Hillary lost, and he stated the reason it should stay, she ripped him apart and gave the entire class a 5 hour test, and stated it was because he DARED to disagree with her...

Is that happening in your schools?

I'm only asking questions....I'd like your answers..

President Trump and his entire family has been vilified, demeaned and disrespected, for one reason and one reason only.......HE WON...

Have you noticed the DEMOCRATS only throw tantrums and OBJECT to everything he does and have NEVER ONCE gotten behind him to make America the best it can be? WHY?
They can't afford to get behind him...he would WIN AGAIN, and they can't let that happen....if he wins again, the Democrat party will be destroyed and they know it...

Did you notice that the ""CAGES"" the left claimed that Trump built to put Illegal children in, WERE BUILT BY OBAMA for the very purpose of PUTTING ILLEGAL CHILDREN IN?
Was THAT all over the news when Obama did it? The very same ""CAGES""...but the media was silent!!

How about when Trump commuted Roger Stone's sentence, and was DEMONIZED 24/7 but NOT A WORD when Obama commuted 1715 inmates, which included 330 that he granted on his last day in office...

DID WE EVEN HEAR one WORD about it?

Were there reporters even reporting it...NO! Just look at the difference in the reporting. By the way, since Trump's been in office he's commuted 10 people...compare that to Obama...Is that reporting fair?

How about when Biden and Obama allowed the H1N1, the SWINE FLU, to INFECT MILLIONS of Americans before declaring it a health emergency....

Was the press losing it's minds and calling it the OBAMAFLU AND BLAMING OBAMA and BIDEN for the spread ? SILENCE!

Compare this to the NEGATIVE COVERAGE that Trump got when, he immediately halted travel from China when, in February, Nancy Pelosi went to Chinatown and said come on down, or when DeBlasio, in March, said ride the subways and go to Broadway...BUT those same people are blaming Trump for the spread of coronavirus..

A FINAL QUESTION:

What have the DEMOCRATS done to help make America the best, to get behind a president that works tirelessly to care about WE THE PEOPLE instead of using us as political pawns..

What have the Democrats done for people of color EXCEPT for GIVING ILLEGALS more rights than citizens and having us pay for it...

JUST imagine what this country could accomplish if the Democrats worked with him on the economy, the coronavirus, the inner cities where he's created opportunity zones, job training etc.

When Trump tried to get school choice for inner-city students they ran Betsy Devoss out!! The dems running those inner-city schools wanted no part of school choice.

Have you ever wondered why it's cities that have been run, for decades, that have the MOST HOMELESS, the MOST CRIME, the most MURDERS, the worst INNER CITY schools, ARE ALL RUN BY DEMOCRATS???

If you haven't started asking yourselves those questions, maybe you should.",2020-09-14T17:11:21Z

Trump didn't care and still doesn't care about the virus unless it impacts on his chances of re-election which clearly this is and now he is frantically trying to rewrite history. Well I'm afraid it won't wash with rational fair minded folk.

Negligent homicide is a criminal charge brought against a person who, through criminal negligence, allows another person to die.

Trump 90 days ago.....""nobody knew how deadly the virus was""
Trump 120 days ago...."" I knew how deadly the virus was and that it was airborne""

The American people are truly blessed to finally have an American President who has worked so hard to try to restore our American heritage, while there is still a glimmer of hope in saving our nation from the thralls of a One-World-Government.

The Bill of Rights: A History

The first 10 amendments to the Constitution make up the Bill of Rights. James Madison wrote the amendments, which list specific prohibitions on governmental power, in response to calls from several states for greater constitutional protection for individual liberties. For example, the Founders saw the ability to speak and worship freely as a natural right protected by the First Amendment. Congress is prohibited from making laws establishing religion or abridging freedom of speech. The Fourth Amendment safeguards citizens’ right to be free from unreasonable government intrusion in their homes through the requirement of a warrant.

The Bill of Rights was strongly influenced by the Virginia Declaration of Rights, written by George Mason. Other precursors include English documents such as the Magna Carta, the Petition of Right, the English Bill of Rights, and the Massachusetts Body of Liberties.

￼One of the many points of contention between Federalists, who advocated a strong national government, and Anti-Federalists, who wanted power to remain with state and local governments, was the Constitution’s lack of a bill of rights that would place specific limits on government power. Federalists argued that the Constitution did not need a bill of rights, because the people and the states kept any powers not given to the federal government. Anti-Federalists held that a bill of rights was necessary to safeguard individual liberty.

Madison, then a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, altered the Constitution’s text where he thought appropriate. However, several representatives, led by Roger Sherman, objected, saying that Congress had no authority to change the wording of the Constitution. Therefore, Madison’s changes were presented as a list of amendments that would follow Article VII.

The House approved 17 amendments. Of these, the Senate approved 12, which were sent to the states for approval in August 1789. Ten amendments were approved (or ratified). Virginia’s legislature was the final state legislature to ratify the amendments, approving them on December 15, 1791.

2020-09-13T12:04:03Z,@Dsslotslv,5nD2s9dWess,"I’m a registered independent, however I have already decided on who I will vote for this coming election. I want to start out by saying that each party has its flaws. In fact, I would do away with the two party system if I could. I also believe that both of our candidates also have their share of imperfections. On one hand we have a president who is very outspoken, unscripted and unpresidential in most of what he says. He can be blunt and say things he doesn’t mean. However, he does care deeply about this country and is making sure we are taken care of economically. He wants nothing but success for us! On the other hand, we have an ex vice president who is slow, doesn’t know what he says most of the time and is not enthusiastic or exciting. However, he does mean well, but he is extremely weak and will bend to his parties will. At this present time, the Democratic Party is not what it used to be. It is falling into the hands of a socialistic radical ideal. If Biden were to become elected, I know he would be a puppet to what his party tells him to do. If you have seen their plans for the future of this country you should be scared! They want to raise taxes for everyone not just the higher class. They also want to give into socialistic principles such as free medical, free tuition and drugs galore. This may sound great at first, but if you look at the fine print you can see exactly what kind of BS it is!!! By raising the taxes sky-high, yes we will get free tuition and free medicine, but at what cost? Giving away free tuition would be awesome, but not if it only lands you a career that will be taxed up the Ying-Yang to where you are payed little to nothing! I currently am pursuing a field in medicine and want to become a doctor one day. However, this is very concerning as all my schooling would basically go towards a career where I will be unfulfilled in my pay. I want my schooling to mean something. Yes my tuition would be free, but my time is not! I want to be rewarded for my hard work and I want to do something that I love which is helping people. I don’t know about you, but not getting paid well for a career that has taken me many years to achieve is something I am not interested in. On the topic of medicine, free medical sounds real nice too, but it also has its downsides. Free medicine is free, but if you have something medically wrong that is expensive to treat or a progressing illness like cancer, diabetes or MS; the hospitals could simply deny paying for it and leave you without proper care. You also could be put on a waiting list and be lucky to receive any kind of treatment before you die from your ailment. The drugs as well are just another means of profit for the government. From what I’ve seen in my travels to Amsterdam and in other parts of Europe, it seems like these drugs are used to suppress people; especially marijuana. If you give these drugs to the people, the government believes it will shut us up. They are using it by means of control to keep us relaxed and stupefied while they run things behind the black curtain. If this sounds familiar to you, it’s because you have heard of it before. This is called communism! And socialism is borderline communism if you didn’t know that by now. Many countries have already collapsed due to this socialistic principle, and socialists in the United States right now want the same outcome for us. They want to destroy this country and ruin us from within. Socialism and communism only benefit two kinds of people. It benefits the high elites and those in politics. Sure it may be good for the members of the green new deal like Bernie Sanders and AOC, but that’s because they won’t be affected. Bernie himself has excelled and profited from a capitalist nation where he has sold countless books and made money from his titles. And yet he wants to make us socialist. Mighty funny of him, especially when socialism won’t be able to touch him in his high office. We would suffer while they simply watch from afar as we self-destruct. I’m a millennial, but I will never be a socialist and I will never support this movement. There are so many people in this country right now that want to destroy it! They go under names that sound nice and sweet; standing for freedom and clean renewable resources like antifa or the green new deal, but trust me, they are wolves in sheep’s clothing. If you haven’t heard their chants and proclamations, they want to destroy this country and rebuild a new, such as the flames that rioters are now ensuing on our cities. They believe a new country will rise from the ashes like new growth after a forest fire. However, this growth will bear the forest of socialism. Please don’t fall for these tricks! I know many of you won’t like it when I say this, but Trump has my vote this coming election. In my opinion he is the lesser of two evils! I know many others including Democrats are thinking the opposite. But please trust me, the democratic party that you know is gone and is no longer the same that it once was. I hope many people see that and try to maintain the Democratic Party’s old ideals and reputation. As of now, Trump has my full support and I hope maybe I can convince you to do the same!!! Protect our country, protect our rights and protect what it means to be an American!Thank you for reading my post!",2020-09-13T12:04:03Z

The hold up in counting was caused when dems got caught ballot dumping in their normal areas that were well known to everyone...and a big battle ensued between the flag bearers and the dems. Their playbook was... they waited until a certain amt of votes were counted that showed trends they didn't  like, so they used to add pre filled out ballots to the count, so ""no one noticed,"" 
and kept adding a few here and there, where needed, and kept it going until their candidate won by the amount needed so as not to cause too many recounts, and none in their  main areas. They have been recorded doing this for at least 30 years. Was he hinting that the FISA on voter fraud is about to be released?",2020-09-13T08:15:55Z

1) After Donald J. Trump (DJT), finishes his successful second term as POTUS.  

2) DJT then runs for and wins the Governor of New York, and Rudi G. runs and wins Mayor of NYC.

3) Then in four years later, DJT runs and wins 8 more years as POTUS, and Rudi G. runs and wins 8 years as Governor of New York State.

4) These strategic actions should to put the entire USA back on the Right track and present to the entire world the Greatest President so far In American History.  Same for Rudi G. as Mayor of NYC and Governor of New York State.

It’s buried in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which calls for stepwise tax increases every two years, by different amounts based on tax brackets. In 2021, it’s people making $10,000-$30,000 who are the first see a tax increase. By 2027, all people with incomes $75,000 or under will face higher taxes than in 2019.



In both of Trump's latest budgets, for 2020 and again in 2021, he proposes to cut hundreds of billions from Medicare, a trillion or more from Medicaid, and tens of billions from Social Security.

See The Young Turks aired 10/31/20 “Trump Funneling Millions to Himself”. Since 2017, Trump’s company has charged taxpayers for hotel rooms, ballrooms, cottages, rental houses, golf carts, candles, candelabras, furniture moving, resort fees, decorative palm trees, strip steak, chocolate cake, breakfast buffets, $88 bottles of wine and $1,000 worth of liquor for White House aides. 
Trump’s campaign and fundraising committee paid $5.6 million to his companies since his inauguration in Jan. 2017. Those payments-turning campaign donations into private revenue - continued even this year, as Trump fell behind in polls and his campaign ran short of money. By Washington Post. 
FREAKING CROOK, Liar 🤥
In April 2018 President Trump welcomed the Japanese prime minister at Mar-a-Lago, in front of a towering arrangement of roses. In the next 2 days, as Trump and Abe talked about trade and N. Korea, Trump’s Palm Beach, Fla., club billed the U.S. government $13,700 for guest rooms, $16,500 for food and wine and $6,000 for the roses and other floral arrangements. Such an honest guy
All of this happening while Americans are not receiving the financial help they need during a Pandemic. So while our government is nickel and diming us, D. Trump is taking up all this taxpayer money and sucking it into his own personal businesses. Way to go dude. Way to believe a liar, aiding and abetting this atrocious behavior",2020-11-01T05:23:05Z

Our Lady comes as Mary, Refuge of Holy Love. She says: ""Praise be to Jesus."" 

""Today, I wish to describe to you the qualifications of a good presidential candidate - a candidate deserving of your support."" 

""Such a candidate is committed to supporting life from conception to natural death. He or she does not use the destruction of life in the womb as a means of garnering political favor."" 

""A good candidate is one who is transparent - holding no secret hidden agendas in the heart, such as weakening the United States so the nation is more open to the One World Order. Truthfulness bears the fruit of transparency. Therefore, one who depends upon lies to protect self is not a good candidate."" 

""A good candidate holds the safety and welfare of the citizenry first and foremost in the heart. Therefore, allowing open borders or thousands of refugees from terror-based nations to enter the country would not be a consideration."" 

""A good candidate lives by and supports the Commandments of God, working always to fulfill God's Will through Holy Love."" 

""You should not try to redefine your Christian morals to fit any certain candidate. The candidate needs to fit his goals into the righteousness of Holy Love - defining Holy Love according to these terms I have given you.""",2020-11-02T01:06:24Z

Given November 15, 2016 
After President Trump‘s election into office. 
Www.holylove.org 
""I am your Jesus, born Incarnate.""
""❗️The problems within this nation will be resolved under this new regime, but not without some division. ❗️With the passage of time, this president-elect will prove himself to be one who cannot be manipulated or coerced into alternatives from his resolve. Much will be accomplished. ❗️Your nation will be stronger and so too the world, as terrorism will be confronted vigorously.""
""❗️Do not believe - no matter who says this - that to be charitable you must generously give 'carte blanche' to all refugees. That is a reckless approach and uncharitable to the legal citizens of this country who deserve protection from terrorists seeking to slip in under the guise of seeking refuge. ❗️A 'safe haven' for refugees should be established in the Middle East and funded by all nations. This type of charity would succeed without the threat of weakened national security.""
""❗️Take pride in your borders once again. ❗️View immigration as a privilege - not a right on demand. ❗️It is not just the underprivileged who have rights, but each and every person from conception to natural death. When this new regime begins, a breath of fresh air will blow across this nation.""

Mary, Refuge of Holy Love says: ""Praise be to Jesus."" 

""Dear children, continue to pray in earnest for President-elect Trump. He will be making life-changing decisions in the future, and decisions which will affect the future of the world. Pray that his heart - his conscience - is guided in Holy Love, for this is the way to peace."" 

""Prosperity is not only economic growth, it is the sense of security and well-being emanating from strong leadership - leadership that is not full of self-interest, but the welfare of those he leads. In today's world, peace can only be assured through militarypower. Therefore, it is good to support a stronger military. To appear weak invites danger and aggression on the part of any enemy. The enemy of all peace is Radical Islamic Terrorism. This evil hides in hearts and then spills out into the world. Be watchful, for any one individual or group of people who show sympathy towards such beliefs."" 

""I am praying with you. I am enthusiastic about many aspects of this country's future. You are under My Mantle of Protection.""

Once again, I (Maureen) see a Great Flame that I have come to know as the Heart of God the Father. He says: ❗️""When one show of power against evil occurs, Satan re-doubles his attempts in attacking righteousness. Sometimes, this is just on a personal level. Other times - such as today in the Middle East* - it is on an international level. The false consciences of many and the political ambition of others must not be the driving force of this great nation.** These are the Trojan Horse of untruth. ❗️❗️Do not be persuaded by lies to believe that recent actions of this President*** were uncalled for. When lives are saved, victory is righteous.""
❗️❗️""Be united as a nation under firm leadership. Do not be misguided by controversy. ❗️Politics must cease ruling the heart of the world. ❗️Wisdom, guided by the Holy Spirit, must transform hearts and justify actions. ❗️❗️Unjustified criticism is the enemy. ❗️❗️Truth is the victory.""

Read 2 Timothy 1:14+
Guard the truth that has been entrusted to you by the Holy Spirit who dwells within us.
Read 2 Timothy 2:24-26+
And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kindly to every one, an apt teacher, forbearing, correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant that they will repent and come to know the truth, and they may escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.

Once again, I (Maureen) see a Great Flame that I have come to know as the Heart of God the Father.  He says: ""Children, follow the lead of My Holy Provision which will always embrace My Commandments.  My Commandments present to you the Truth which is difficult to discover in these times.  Do not lend support to anyone who does not live in the Truth.  That person will only lead you astray and usurp all your assets to his own advantage.""


❗️""Beware of the 'New World Order'.  It is the master plan of the Antichrist.  It paves the way for corruption of the mind and the spirit.  ❗️This is not as it is portrayed - a unity of all people and all nations.  ❗️❗️It is based upon Communism,* which, as you must realize, was an oppression of the people - even of religious beliefs.  Only a few leaders led a good life but they were the ones guilty of oppressing all the others.""


""Children, you were placed upon earth during these times to face unique challenges.  Do not succumb to those who lie to you.  Support the Truth both in prayer and sacrifice.  This is a step against the Antichrist.""

Dear Fellow Americans,

Enjoy last days of Election!

Whether you like Biden or Trump, it's your choice;
Whether you prefer corruption or justice, it's your taste;
But you should know in advance that

Voting for Biden = Brooking Corruption;
Voting for Biden = Promoting Hypocrisy;
Voting for Biden = Raising Taxes;
Voting for Biden = Heading to Doom & Gloom.

vs

Voting for Trump = Voting for Justice;
Voting for Trump = Voting for Frankness;
Voting for Trump = Voting for Prosperity.
Voting for Trump = Leading to Boom & Bloom.

This short video (youtube.com/watch?v=JSVz2KSIAIk) contrasts the two presidential candidates through aspects of
Fighting COVID-19
American Families
Race in America
Climate Change
National Security
Leadership.

I wish you enjoy & share, and dance with the music on the way of voting...",2020-11-01T19:48:36Z

Opinion by Jennifer Rubin

September 8, 2020 at 7:45 AM EDT

President Trump is fighting a losing battle against reports of his talk about the military, which he claims to revere but deeply resents. Multiple news organizations, including The Post, have confirmed private comments he made disparaging those who served as “suckers” and “losers.” These and his previous remarks — disrespecting POWs and allegedly telling the wife of a slain serviceman that her husband Sgt. La David T. Johnson “knew what he signed up for” — are consistent with the narcissist’s felt need to maintain an unduly high opinion of himself by diminishing others who have plainly surpassed him in courage and competence. Trump ducked military service; the valiant men and women who went in his place therefore must be denigrated, pitied and scorned. How foolish they went to war for me!

Trump can deny his animosity until the cows come home but he remains unable to articulate real respect for those who have served. Recall the scene in “A Very Stable Genius,” by Post reporters Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, in which Trump called the service chiefs “a bunch of dopes and babies” and barked, “You’re all losers. You don’t know how to win anymore.” Trump did it all over again at a Monday news conference.

Follow the latest on Election 2020

He insisted (contrary to polling) that the rank and file troops are in love with him. However, he declared, “The top people in the Pentagon probably aren’t because they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies — that make the bombs, and make the planes, and make everything else — stay happy. But we’re getting out of the endless wars.”

In other words, they are bloodthirsty warmongers. The notion that generals want wars reveals his utter lack of understanding of the sacred responsibility commanders have for the troops and the sacrifices their own families have endured. Only a man shamed for having avoided war could imagine that those who serve are bloodthirsty savages.

He simply cannot help himself. His niece, Mary L. Trump, reminds us that in the peculiar Trump family, military service was scorned and not celebrated. “Growing up in a mansion in Jamaica Estates in Queens, Trump heard the family criticize those who joined the military instead of going into business. Trump and his father, Fred Trump Sr., were especially harsh in criticizing the decision by Donald’s older brother, Fred Jr., to join the U.S. Air National Guard‚” my colleague Michael Kranish reported, quoting Mary Trump. “My father was frequently ridiculed for his career choices and disparaged for serving our country by both his father and by his brother Donald,” Mary Trump said.

Trump not only resents those who serve but also is at a loss to understand concepts like honor, discipline, sacrifice and loyalty. He thinks pardoning war criminals will make him popular with men and women in uniform who have sworn to uphold the Constitution and live by the military code of conduct. (Likewise, he thinks it will impress decent and law-abiding police officers when he says they should not “be too nice” putting suspects in patrol cars.) Likewise, he once thought his cheering for war crimes — bombing the wives and family members of terrorists — would be impressive, until soon-to-be secretary of defense James Mattis set him straight.

Trump reminds one of someone trying to fake fluency in a foreign language. Over and over, he makes glaring errors because he has no idea what he is talking about.

At this point, only the most committed cult members believe Trump’s denials. The rest of us can see and hear him for ourselves. Trump’s enormous ego and his shameful conduct when asked to serve mean he can never accord our military men and women — at whatever rank — the respect they deserve.
