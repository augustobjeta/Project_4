There are countless other women who bought into the hype that children in the womb aren't worthy of human rights, who later change their minds. The attitude that ""a woman-should-be-able-to-do-what-she- wants-with- her-own-body, leads to faulty thinking that the babe in her womb is part of the mother's body. Who doesn't know that a mother's DNA can never be the same as her offsprings, or anyone elses, unless that individual her identical sibling?  Then who does live in their mom's body; has their own unique human DNA; and is living and growing according to the pattern in which all people grow, and is, of course, a separate person? Geeze: that's a no-brainer: her child, of course!. Do pro-choicers forget that ""All people be CREATED free and equal?""  If we have our own unique human DNA from conception until our deaths, how can we be anything other than humans? . So why shouldn't all babies in the womb have full human rights? Referring to the youngest amoung us as ""embryos and fetuses"" is merely a way to muddle the thinking in some. But these are simply stages of human development: stages which continue after birth from newborns, toddlers, etc. all the way to and including the olders amongst us, the centurians.. 
   What is so special about being born that would make such a difference that those who have not yet been born, should not have the rights afforded to all other people? After all, babies continue to be the same person in and out of the womb.. Why is an identical twin who has been born afforded full human rights; while the identical twin in the womb... according to Hilary... should have no human rights; that the government should allow an abortionest to turn the living baby around and crush his skull so he pull the child out dead, and without being  charged with child abuse and murder? Why shoudn't the government protect the most powerless and vulnerable amough us: our own unborn children? Who could believe that some living people have bodies with 4 legs and arms and eyes; two or more hearts and heads,, etc.? Only pro-choicers, of course  : \
  If Hilary were really for women and children, she'd be supportive of promoting mothers' maternal instincts to protect and love all her children: both in and out of the womb.  Perhaps what Hilary really wants is to promote only healthy, ""normal"" kids; and kill off defenseless handicapped babies in the womb, while it's still legal to do so. But handicapped people should have all the same human rights that everyone else does. To think otherwise, I believe, is Hitleresque.",2016-11-03T03:31:19Z

want to accept tens of thousands of Syrian refugees in the very near 
future.  They claim refuges will only be allowed into the country after 
being ""vetted"" meaning they will have undergone an extensive background 
investigation.  Don't be fooled by this rhetoric. Below is only 
one example of the many Afghans who have served, shoulder to shoulder, 
with our fighting men and women, proven their loyalty, and have put their, and their families lives in jeopardy assisting our troops on the battlefields in Afghanistan. 
 I have written several  Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) letters for 
Afghans I know and trust who have assisted me with my efforts in 
Afghanistan and I have seen their frustration as the ""vetting"" process 
slowly progresses.  Currently, the average wait time for an Afghan 
Interpreter to receive their visa is approximately 3 years. How 
then, if it takes up to 3 years to properly vet  Afghans who have proven
 their loyalty serving with our troops, is it possible to process tens 
of thousands of refugees, who have little to no traceable background in 
such a short amount of time?

Because we are America and should lead by America's own foundations and constitutions only.  Our judicial systems of the Supreme Court should only divide the wrong from the right by our country's own constitutions not by anything else, including the partisanship, powers, ideologies, fantacies, favorites, own recognitions...etc., but to divide by America's own patriotism and loyalty as the principles from the only standard of America's own rules of the laws of constitutions.  Because this is America of America's own foundations and constitutions only, not anything else.

This is also why I fully supported Gov.Bush before by his great leaderships experiences for America's own greatness until he was suspended by things have nothing to do with him at all times. üò† Since I believe Gov.Bush will be more than qualified to be our next President for America's own greatness.  Now, we will vote for Mr.Trump, since he was nominated by GOP and I believe his views of the importance of the principles of America's own foundations and constitutions are absolutely important and necessarily.  I believe that the former 1st Lady Clinton's views of America's own constitutions should go by what she believes in is wrong, because our country's own constitutions are there to follow up with instead of following up or not by any individuals' hobbies, favorites, or willingness, but to follow up with only without the choice.  America's own constitutions is the only measurement to decide what should we do and how should we do for America's own foundations of America's own greatness.  It's our country's Gov't's duties to govern by America's own constitutions only.  This is why every new President must swear by the Bibles to maintain, protect and defend America's own foundations of the Capitalism systems of the liberty and entrepreneurships by America's own constitutions.  Because America's own foundations and constitutions for America's own greatness were never come easily, it came from many many heroic patriotic brave hearts like President Washington, Bush 41, Gen Mattis, Gen. Robert Gates, The defense Secretary Rumsfeld, Gen. Powell, Gen. Petraeus and many many, including our Founding Fathers' sacrefice by lives and deaths for America's own greatness and principles by sets of America's own foundations and constitutions for America's own greatness, patriotism and loyalty as the principles.    However, I believe we should  respect our 2nd Ammendment, but also I agree with the former 1st Lady Clinton that make sure guns are not exposed to young peoples under 18 years old, which will cause unnecessary deaths.  The most important thing is the guns are only there for patriotic Americans who love our country and following up with our own country's rules of the laws.",2016-10-20T20:58:55Z

Abortion isn't a political issue. It's a human rights issue. Even bernie supporters and sensible ""progressives"" side more with the GOP position on abortion. ""social justice"" should start in the womb. The majority of the country (especially millennials according to Pew research) is terribly away from the Democrat's stance on late term abortion (which is that its ""ok""). Hillary's just lucky her opponent is trump. If it were any other republican, he/she would have wiped the floor with her on abortion, unlike trump's clown like arguments. Murder is never a right ""choice"", no matter how you spin it. A society is judged by how it protects its most vulnerable.

2016-10-20T14:00:50Z,@nicecooper1236,cyx5e2c1SgU,"To answer the question of accepting the result of the election or not, I
 will say this: if the result represents people's genuine choice without
 being tainted in any way, people will accept it; if not, people will 
not accept it, why should I?

When Hillary called Donald Trump ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù during the final debate, Trump went directly into a cat-fight which is what Mr. Farage warned him not to get into. If I were Trump, I would have said: when the mainstream media intimidates people not reading Wikileads emails by themselves but quote ‚Äúyou are learning from US!‚Äù, who is whose puppet? 
After the debate, Hillary went around, chatted around, wearing her faking smile and the social-life-use-only exaggerated facial expressions which qualify her to be nothing further than an average PR for a private company, except the way she was standing on the stage: keeping her feet shoulder length apart, which was probably because of her health issue. 
I have commented on her saying ‚ÄúAmerica is great because America is good‚Äù which literally makes not much sense even to many English speakers but she repeated not only in the second debate but also in the final debate. The only reason I can see she stuck in this mind was to target Trump‚Äôs slogan: ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù. With Obama‚Äôs endorsement, she has no choice but to deny the status quo of America and painted Obama‚Äôs legacy to ‚ÄúGreat America‚Äù.
In the closing statement, she said ‚ÄúI need you‚Äù which seemed incomplete. Yes, Hillary does need your vote, no matter you are actually the 99% in her ‚Äúbasket of deplorable‚Äù, no matter she calls you N* word behind your back, she at least needs you for once! 
As a conclusion, I would like to quote a comment given by a Netizen, Culo Tetas y Panocha : ‚ÄùForeign countries used to look up to America. We now look down to America.‚Äù BTW, I will not be surprised if I am called puppet of China or whatever. - -ÂæãÊîøÊ∑∑Ê∑∑Ôºå IForYou, Tumblr blogger (English/Chinese), a voice for little people, ordinary people and minority people in Quebec, Canada!",2016-10-20T14:00:50Z

It's a little ridiculous that Hillary isn't in jail right now, and it's a little ridiculous that anyone would consider her. This is coming from someone who doesn't like Trump all that much as a person, but Hillary is so malicious and so blatantly wrong that it's embarrassing. I hope this election won't be ringed, even though WikiLeaks shows the left's involvement in doing so (screwing over Burney and literally changing votes), and I hope we realize that Hillary is lying and manipulating us.",2016-10-20T14:42:36Z
2016-10-20T13:52:10Z,@nicecooper1236,dXWdiz--X0s,"When Hillary called Donald Trump ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù during the final debate, Trump went directly into a cat-fight which is what Mr. Farage warned him not to get into. If I were Trump, I would have said: when the mainstream media intimidates people not reading Wikileads emails by themselves but quote ‚Äúyou are learning from US!‚Äù, who is whose puppet? 
After the debate, Hillary went around, chatted around, wearing her faking smile and the social-life-use-only exaggerated facial expressions which qualify her to be nothing further than an average PR for a private company, except the way she was standing on the stage: keeping her feet shoulder length apart, which was probably because of her health issue. 
I have commented on her saying ‚ÄúAmerica is great because America is good‚Äù which literally makes not much sense even to many English speakers but she repeated not only in the second debate but also in the final debate. The only reason I can see she stuck in this mind was to target Trump‚Äôs slogan: ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù. With Obama‚Äôs endorsement, she has no choice but to deny the status quo of America and painted Obama‚Äôs legacy to ‚ÄúGreat America‚Äù.
In the closing statement, she said ‚ÄúI need you‚Äù which seemed incomplete. Yes, Hillary does need your vote, no matter you are actually the 99% in her ‚Äúbasket of deplorable‚Äù, no matter she calls you N* word behind your back, she at least needs you for once! 
As a conclusion, I would like to quote a comment given by a Netizen, Culo Tetas y Panocha : ‚ÄùForeign countries used to look up to America. We now look down to America.‚Äù BTW, I will not be surprised if I am called puppet of China or whatever. - -ÂæãÊîøÊ∑∑Ê∑∑Ôºå IForYou, Tumblr blogger (English/Chinese), a voice for little people, ordinary people and minority people in Quebec, Canada!",2016-10-20T13:52:10Z

First, I honestly express my gratefulness to the American Nation who is feeding generously and selflessly millions of needy people round the earth. The Darfuri people, whether they are living in displacement camps or refugee camps should pray for a powerful, strong, wealthy America. America is our first hope, without ignoring or denying the help we have been recieving from other nations. Let me frankly disclose the fact that many families in Darfur, and certainly in other parts of the world, are recieving a lot of help from their famiy members working in nations such as America. sometimes this is only source of livilhood for many. So, it is understandable if we expressed our fears about Mr. Trump's statements on immigration. America is values and she is strong with these values. We pray for a strong American of the great values. We deeply and sincerely thank the American people for so sacrificing for the wider human family.

This is all rooted in desire for excess federal government and more excuses to keep some useless bureaucracies. She mentions small business which is bogus, yea they want them small because in her dream world everyone works for a bureaucracy. She and Bill don't want to admit such a thing but the economic boom of the 90s was a direct result of Reagan's economic policies and taxes. It also helped Bill wasn't a complete radical like Obama and HRC. First you have to make it attractive for a business to operate here and just in case any of these dumbasses forget business is a ""for profit"" venture. So it makes sense to leave under such outrageous tax, and they're allowed to because they're private. This is what Trump in my opinion should stress, rather than bully a private enterprise into staying with penalties. We're walking a fine line of killing our Constitution. Yes there would be even more of a debt if they spent as much as they did under Obama admin with Trump's taxes but that won't happen. Obama is an incompetent man with selfish political ideologies that goes out of bounds (exec orders) beyond the will of the House. That is non neutral behavior as is Clinton. Let's not forget loopholes are *legal* because they're called deductions. Don't like it? change the law. I personally like a flat tax. Who needs IRS then, which has shown to be incredibly politicized via a crusty twat like Lerner. Some bureaucracies are needed in Federal level I concede, but it is way out of control. The States are meant to hold most of these tasks. Who really wants to work for a bureaucracy anyways and not provide a product or service that anyone really needs? The big business she loves to hate are in her pockets and give the jobs whether she likes it or not. She wants to demonize them for that? Watch them leave and see what happens.",2016-10-02T11:22:50Z

This is no 'equal' bad option. Hillary is bad, but Trump is ABYSMALLY bad- you have all had enough time and exposure to him now to see this.

The only concrete plan he talked about was to cut taxes to the already wealthy entrepreneurs and if that is a good plan.... well, I don't wanna know the rest.

(30:00) Trump believes that because he pays no tax (yup, he pays NO tax), that makes him ""smart."" 

(34:10) He justifies not paying any tax by claiming his tax dollars would only ""be squandered"". 

(1:09:05) Trump believes that the USA should have taken all of Iraq's oil, ""I've been saying for a long time... we should have taken the oil."" This would have been seen as an act of imperialist aggression, against which the free world would have been forced to act. Yup, the world would either have invoked sanctions against, or declared war upon the USA.

2016-09-27T16:40:20Z,@4mydearlady,lIexQNGxwog,"I watched this as objectively as I could. As far as I could tell Hillary lost the first 24 minutes. What she needs to make Trump and wealthy people like Trump answer is this: even if wealthy corporations are given tax breaks for not shipping jobs overseas, are those corporations going to pay American workers fair workers with benefits once given tax incentives? It won't matter if jobs are not being shipped overseas but those corporations don't create NEW JOBS! The tax breaks for the companies won't matter if American workers are not given full-time hours, fair pay, and benefits because the company owners are buying yachts, private jets, strippers, third vacation homes, etc.

But folks saying Clinton lost this debate either didn't watch all of it or if they did they didn't process his answers well. Trump blew this debate. You don't win debates by agreeing with your opponent several times, which he did when it seemed he didn't know what else to say. Or he made bizarre comments, ""Could be Russia, could be China, could be some 400 pound guy on his computer?"" WTH?

Two, in terms of the airports being nicer in China. China is not exactly a great model of economic development for America to follow. The airport is newer at the expense of China's poorer citizens. That's common sense.

Three, it's abhorrent that he won't release his tax returns when he can under audit!  It's abhorrent that he brags about not paying federal taxes when if anyone else did that, they're wages would be garnished.

He admits to stiffing his contractors - he's stiffed his lawyers! - and brags about it during this debate. ""They didn't do a good job."" Hundreds of people, Trump? Yet, he will bring jobs to America. He hasn't even paid the people that put up his drapes in his buildings!

""Frisk and search"" was deemed unconstitutional and mostly Hispanics and blacks were targeted. Period. There are bad people in the Hispanic and Black community out there, just like there are in any community, and those individuals should be locked up, but every Black person in the Black community doesn't deserve to be frisked and search at a cop's will.

Hillary spoke of criminal justice reform. All Trump barked about was backing up the cops. All Black and Hispanic neighborhoods are not cesspools of crime and not all Black and Hispanic neighborhoods are as tragic as Trump are making them sound. For him to state that, it's racist and it gives Black people who go to work, go to school, buy their groceries, and mind their business sound like fictional characters. 

Also, Trump insults Hispanics too often. You can't insult the largest ethnic group in this country - Hispanics - and count on them to vote for in November. Doesn't work like that. And his assertion, ""I think I developed a very, very good relationship with the African-American community"" is laughable. Blacks are the second biggest minority group in this country and all but the most stalwart Black Republicans will be voting for Hillary this November. 

It is a mathematical certainty that Trump will lose the popular vote in November. His only shot may be the electoral college vote.",2016-09-27T20:31:00Z

Trump is right that Hilary will just continue with the same agenda as Obama, while Trump makes sense of whats really happening .. the ""wasteful"" spending ..

She has more experience, and better diplomatic skills in expressing herself. But her long experience has shown that she has not done a pristine job throughout her long political experience.
Donald Trump is a breath of fresh air: His action oriented temperament points to some much needed fresh air in American politics - which has been stagnant and stale over the last several years!
American public is fed up with the no-good-progress policies of the last two decades!

And you prefer refinement, wordsmithing, politeness, and all that.  But if you are concerned about the economy, national security, stopping ISIS, taking care of Vets, rebuilding a strong military and intelligence.  Then I think the choice is pretty clear.  IF you want someone who knows how to put on a ""mask"" or ""facade"" on  and step in front of a camera without too much passion or emotion - but your are okay with terror attacks on US soil, the rising national debt, The wide open southern border, and a weak military and intelligence, then Hillary is your girl.  But remember this is the campaign, and a nationally televised debate.  After she wins she will not put in as much effort on that ""facade"".  Its fake anyway.

And what I think about all 5 parts of the Republican Party Debate is that Rubio, Trump, and Cruz are squabbling with each other but the other candidate on the right just watches them and waits for his turn who doesn't budge in when the other candidates are trying to prove their point, but he describes his point very clearly just to see what the people think.

But overall Rubio and Cruz want to knock out Trump in the Debate while Trump proves his points against both of them just to satisfy the people in the crowd while the governor on the right just proves how and what he's going to do that is right to fully satisfy the people as well as other countries and their leaders.",2020-01-03T06:25:04Z

Up is down, left is right.  Crime is crime. Nonviolent crime and marijuana should be handled less severe. Except for white collar crime.  Lack of punishment is detrimental to any society. Chicago has shown that.  A prosecutor who doesn‚Äôt prosecute. Crimes with no punishment.  No bonds required.  A free society comes with a greater freedom of choice. People are free to make bad choices and good ones.  Personal responsibility is missing from this debate. Fatherless homes.  What breaks my heart is seeing kids that never had a chance because they are often raised by a loving mother, by herself, who can‚Äôt do it all alone.  It starts with the home.  Very little focus on the home, the family unit. The actual statistics of those criminals and their background.  Often from broken homes. Single mothers with a variety of fathers who just don‚Äôt take responsibility. That is the crime. That is systemic.

But not a peep about that.  Black on black violence is crazy high. Living in Chicago I see/hear it every weekend. Prosecutors who make excuses and won‚Äôt prosecute. Cashless bonds. A city where the politicians rather give money towards illegal immigrants than the black neighborhoods.  If you‚Äôre a citizen and homeless you can‚Äôt get a roof. If you came here illegally you get a hotel room.  Democrats policies are full of feel good that does wrong.  They want abortion but will use tax payer money to take care of people who came here illegally. 

Close the borders.  Find a path for some amnesty if the circumstances warrant. Criminals should be sent away.  Legal migrants should be applauded and revered, not systematically harassed with rules to become a citizen that are shredded by a political party trying to grow its base at the expense of our country.

The politics has gotten so out of wack, differing policies conflict with each other.  Personally, I don‚Äôt like guns, never owned one, probably never will despite living in Chicago.  But if I did want one, I should be able to get one with a background check.

Other countries who have less guns still have violence.  In the UK, knife violence is a king to guns. Slashing, murders etc. the % of violence is likely higher in the U.S. however regardless of the weapon.  The breakdown of the family, kids without dads, politicians who prefer victim politics than self sufficiency.

For a population of 320 million people we destroyed our economy forcing people into unemployment, people are losing their homes and renters are being evicted.

Thats mostly the very elderly and the very young, covid is barely a small fraction of that. Thanks ""news"" media for spreading fear and panic, for bashing our politicians who even attempt to say anything that resembles sanity, Your filthy greed has sent an already limping nation over the edge, we will be trying to recover from this economic disaster for a decade.

..A picture began circulating in November. It should be ""The Picture of the Year,"" or perhaps, ""Picture of the Decade."" It won't be. In fact, unless you obtained a copy of the U.S. paper which published it, you probably would never have seen it.

The picture is that of a 21-week-old unborn baby named Samuel Alexander Armas, who is being operated on by surgeon named Joseph Bruner. The baby was diagnosed with spina bifida and would not survive if removed from his mother's womb. Little Samuel's mother, Julie Armas, is an obstetrics nurse in Atlanta. She knew of Dr. Bruner's remarkable surgical procedure. Practicing at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, he performs these special operations while the baby is still in the womb.

During the procedure, the doctor removes the uterus via C-section and makes a small incision to operate on the baby. As Dr. Bruner completed the surgery on Samuel, the little guy reached his tiny, but fully developed hand through the incision and firmly grasped the surgeon's finger. Dr. Bruner was reported as saying that when his finger was grasped, it was the most emotional moment of his life, and that for an instant during the procedure he was just frozen, totally immobile.

The photograph captures this amazing event with perfect clarity. The editors titled the picture, ""Hand of Hope."" The text explaining the picture begins, ""The tiny hand of 21-week-old fetus Samuel Alexander Armas emerges from the mother's uterus to grasp the finger of Dr. Joseph Bruner as if thanking the doctor for the gift of life.""

Little Samuel's mother said they ""wept for days"" when they saw the picture. She said, ""The photo reminds us pregnancy isn't about disability or an illness, it's about a little person"" Samuel was born in perfect health, the operation 100 percent successful. Now see the actual picture, and it is awesome...incre dible....and hey, pass it on! The world needs to see this one!",2020-01-13T22:24:41Z

Nobody wants to go through 4 years of med school + 3-7 years of residency to make a mediocre amount of money. That is why doctors get paid so much. (on top of that only naturally smart and hardworking people can consider becoming doctors) The fact is that that is what is necessary for someone to become a good doctor and if the system were changed it would be destroyed.

IT was on Larry King Live show  Ross Perot V al Gore debate. We need to cut trade or tax the living hell out of it so it would be cheaper to open back up in America.

Personally, and after doing my fair share of research, watching the debates and learning about both their respective platforms throughout their political career until now, if you truly stop and put things in perspective for the sole benefit of our country's best interests, it is Mr. Sanders who best deserves and is without a doubt the most qualified, deserving candidate to represent the democratic party, crush elections, and become the next president of the US! Nonetheless, I also like Hillary and contemplated my standing, frankly, because she's a woman and I, like any other feminist, believe it would be great to see a qualified woman in a powerful and unprecedented position but as a US citizen, I also think its our main responsibility to support the candidate that will most efficiently serve our country and most importantly, make it a more viable place we can be proud of!

Now, I do not live in the United States of America but, at least as I see it, you have to believe that: (a) people living in Burlington and the State of Vermont have, somehow, stopped being members of the human species; or (b) Senator Sanders is the one best able to represent people's interests.

I think it's a problem with their character clashing with there style of communication (which might be what it takes to communicate with people in the 21st century politics), but for that reason, I could never see myself idolizing the morals a politician.

You can see, and good on Bernie for deflecting it, but part of the problem are the hosts here.

People react like the heavens will fall from the skies and the whole country will collapse, while in fact it's just the opposite. it just means that everyone has a basic standard of living AS A HUMAN RIGHT. It means that you won't have to worry about going bankrupt when you fall ill or need surgery, because everyone has health 
insurance and medical and medicine costs are regulated to prevent price gauging. Everyone has a RIGHT to a roof above his or her head, so when you fall under a certain income threshold you will get financial support to pay for your rent (up to a certain threshold). Roads and bridges are continuously built and maintained by the government. If everyone has a right to get an education, regardless of his or her income, everybody gets a chance to contribute to society. So instead of being stuck to 
flipping burgers, he or she might actually become an architect, an entrepreneur, a doctor or even develop the next type of solar panel. This is in fact all VERY WELL possible, it only requires that everyone pays a bit more tax (those at the top quite a bit more or that they pay their tax AT ALL) and that we stop bailing out big banks with government (tax payer) money and that we hold corrupt and fraudulent bankers accountable for their misconduct.",2016-03-05T14:48:03Z

2016-03-05T09:30:14Z,@popd8830,ti2Nokoq1J4,"What they need to do about the drugs is change the communities idea of what a community / family is. Growing up in Baltimore the Don't snitch ideology is greater than the protect the community. People such as this wouldn't know nor would care about the ROOTS of society and from where issues evolve. It isn't just about drugs though, it's also about the gap between the risks and reward. If someone sells drugs, they can rely on their friends to protect them and even strangers while they make much more money along with not having to lose their position of power. 

These people ignore completely the forces that drive these issues. On top of this they also mention guns, but realistically speaking you can obtain guns easily apparently from the deep web, and drugs of course are just as easy. In middle school there were people exchanging pills in Parkville MD whether the teacher turned his back or left the room. They were brazen enough to do it in between class exchanges. In highschool after we moved, there was a stairwell that people would do their drugs almost daily. Just recently my cousin was offered pills at the local Royal Farms. And to end look at the healthcare system with the obamacare. 

After it's implementation and to this day I get emails threatening me to get coverage. In PA I don't qualify, even unemployed there's nothing. at one point I was working 5 hours a week, barely making 25 a month after taxes. The lowest available and still available today is 200 dollars for the most basic (doctor visits with a 50 dollar co-pay) just to be informed that I'm basically screwed and will not be able to change anything. Currently I'm 28, I had been working since highschool and since Obamas administration (he isn't fully the issue but a big part of companies closing/ such low wages) I've had issue with work. This is also on top of having a 30 grand college debt after sticking it out and obtaining my associates. Keep in mind that I received a scholarship, and had been on the deans list for the final 2 semesters before graduating. 

Currently I'm trying to find a reason to go on since my degree is in criminal justice and I have nowhere to go with it. In PA they do not cover training programs, and there are no real jobs available in my area. (roughly 2 officers for the entire littlestown area and when I needed an officer we had to wait for a state police officer). So I ask what do I do with the debt and all the other issues beyond my control? Go back to a supermarket job that's minimum wage (also there are no public transportation so I'd have to get a vehicle, monthly insurance which is a few hundred, healthcare for the job, and on top of that make enough to cover student debt) So how do I move on? They mentioned loan forgiveness which was an empty promise and there was no job assistance for graduates. It was a long 6 months of no contact followed by constant calls from debt collectors. 

I also need to mention I moved up to PA from Maryland so from there I had been a recluse. Growing up with people who treated me like dirt thanks to my Spanish name (in spite of being raised by my American mother and being born / raised here with no hand outs just her alone working full time), I never had been social. And to this day I hate people / relying on them so I'm here to see what other think, how do I survive? How do I carry on without leeching off the government? Become a beggar? I can only live with my parents for so long after long since blowing all of my savings From my last job. There's a reason why I only leave the house when my aunt sends me money for holidays to buy canned food. My mother and step father can only tolerate me for so long before I'm another vagrant pan handling on the streets.",2016-03-05T09:30:14Z

A lot of the issues that are going on and are being brought up here, are issues that people in America have brought to themselves, like crimes and violence, drug problems, public safety, etc. The best way to fix these problems are not what these candidates, are proposing, although they are good proposals, but it's actually the people changing their attitudes and behaviors. I am a person of color, but how come I don't experience these issues about discrimination and police profiling?  It's because I live a decent life. And I think these candidates know that, but don't have the balls to tell the people, that it is not up to the President, but is up to the people to change.

I just think that if Sanders gets into office, his grand schemes will hit a reality wall and he will spend his office struggling.  Clinton on the other hand knows the inner workings and will be able to achieve more. (BTW I'm a republican in the center, but Trump is making me reconsider all of that).

Hilary clinton seems to have the most typical response to each question.
1. acknowledge problem by using examples that are heartfelt
2. throw statistics at problem
3. vaguely outline what her plan is
4. summate about how we cant ignore it.
Also language like, 'we must try to', or 'we have to help *blank* to enable *blank* to help *blank*' is rather scattered and inconclusive.

yes hilary, we understand the questions are topical, can you please introduce information and opinion on your particular stance.

Martin O'malley had some opinions i aligned with, however i feel he is not strong enough of a candidate, in polls or calibre to win the later election or follow through with his opinions throughout the presidency.

How many people go see the doctor in a year? Once maybe twice? Yet you pay a monthly fee the rest of the time you don't go! So your not getting taxed but your still paying for it? So I ask why not have a tax where everyone doesn't have to worry about having a fat bill after seeing a doctor? It's like having earthquake insurance in the mid-west. It might happen but your still paying for something that ""might happen""? Well you say doctor would be flooded with patients? I don't know anyone that likes seeing the doctor, they rather go to work sick than miss out on the money they need to survive. Which gets others sick and the wheel keeps turning. I didn't have insurance last year, and was fined 600.00.¬†That is fine. I had plenty of time to sign up for medical insurance "" which is a cluster of¬†choosing doctor's, plans, sites"", which just made me just give up! But where did my 600 dollar fine go to?¬†Did it go towards my medical need or yours? No it didn't it just went in to the government who deems where it is used for. My money that I put into the system! If it went to my fellow American fine.¬†If it went to the national debt....fine. But millions if not trillions of dollars of people without medical insurance are getting¬†fined, and the money is not going to get you better health care or your family! You are getting ""taxed"" or paying for it no matter what. So I say again Why not universal health care?

Bernie is a very rare Saint in politics. He is like a Pope Francis in politics. Mahatma Gandhi and Mother Teresa would have been proud of him and would certainly have endorsed Bernie Sanders. Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela would have approved.
I have watched with amazement and admiration his speeches and debates. I have read about his life. He voted against the war in Iraq. I agree with him that judgement is more important than mere experience. We must not forget that there were no Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) found in Iraq. We must not forget that about 4497 Americans have died in Iraq and over 32021 Americans wounded. Between 500,000 - 1 million Iraqis died, among them 112,000 - 123,000 were innocent Iraqi civilians. Who will comfort the grieving families? We owe it to those who died and to those who are wounded to make the right choice for President of the most powerful country on earth. We must not forget that the Middle East is in a deep mess right now partly because of the wrong war in Iraq. The world is watching the United States Presidential election and the world is following Bernie Sanders. Millions who normally would not follow the US elections are now keenly interested. All because of Bernie Sanders. Yes some are interested in Donald Trump too. But Bernie is the rock star. 
The number one rule in successful foreign policy is to have trust and integrity. Bernie has authenticity, sincerity and the credibility to win over foreign leaders and nations. I trust Bernie to lead not only America but the whole world.
People across the world are following Bernie Sanders wishing that he becomes the next President of the United States. He is inspiring hope in Asia, Africa, South America, Europe and other parts of the world. 
Having myself been an elected legislator and parliamentarian at both the State and Federal/National level in India, the largest democracy in the world, I have striven all my life to live by my conscience because we owe it to the poor. I realize how hard it is to keep clean and honest in politics where big money is constantly tempting you. I recognise a fellow traveller in Senator Bernie Sanders.
I humbly appeal to all Americans, Democrat, Republican, Independents, all white Americans, all African-Americans, all Latino Americans, all Native Americans, all Asian Americans, all Americans of Indian origin, men and women, young and old and people of all races and political backgrounds to support this Saint in politics. Bernie sometimes brings tears to my eyes when he speaks which testifies to his authenticity. Giving young people free college and university education is the right step if America is to become and remain the leader in education. Those who say that America cannot afford it should remember that the Iraq War cost the US over $2 trillion and counting. So from the land of Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Teresa and from the foothills of the Himalayas, I support and salute you Senator Bernie Sanders. I do not have a vote but I offer you moral and spiritual support. I dedicate my book ‚ÄúLiving Heaven Here on Earth ‚Äì Finding the Divinity Within You‚Äù to Bernie Sanders. You have my intense prayers. I hope that you become the next President of the United States of America. Feel the Bern.

The world is in turbulence, America is a great ctry in spite all odds, change is a gradual process and things can just to be the best in a blink of an eye. The present situation is an off-shoot of the bad administration of President Bush, there some controversy surrounding his elections, attack of Iraq, failure to tackle Alquaeda, etc. These were all inherited by Pdt Obama; the question is wat did he achieve and wat is still left undone?

It seem a lot of attention in the world is diverted towards entertainment, this is not only happening in the US bt Africa.

2016-02-06T14:20:06Z,@jesp999,ti2Nokoq1J4,"Hillary's supporters might find she is being accused unfairly of not having a backbone, What some people, even Hillary does not realize, is that the information you know depends directly on your own ability to stand alone and investigate things with intelligent judgement, and seek out information from the right sources. Therefore, corporate influence also takes to form of the influence of who you spend time with. So if you have to raise money you are spending time talking to and with those people all the time. Corporate influence is to be around the people in power and in the roles of power. So corporate power giving money to politicians it is not always a outwardly blatant bribery model, like they are paying you to pass this or that bill, they wrote. It is an influence model, and they use many many subtle tactics in that. They constantly feed you information when you are always hanging out and spending your time with the wrong people. So who you hang out with does influence your character. There is a recent video on youtube where a young person confronts Hillary on Fracking and Hillary does not say she will try to oppose fracking forcefully and she does say she thinks there are ways it can be done safely without accidents or errors. This is a good example of corporate interest being subtle. I live in colorado I have seen how coporations put out false studys on fracking. I had a landlord who was on a pretty high position in the Colorado government and we had a conversation about fracking a few years ago, and he a friend to and always supported. Govenor Hickenlooper. One day ending a meeting with my landlord i told him I was late to a fracking protest i was attending and he gave me a speech about how fracking is not dangerous so i engaged him in a conversations. He was a Democrat and a nice guy, He is a father and a caring person and want in his heart to help others. But he was feed a lot of lies and false information. He was not wise on the fact because the information he had was all fed to him by the corporations. He told me how the corporations actually took him out to fracking sites to ""show him and Hickenlooper"" how safe it was. After some time spent listening to my analysis of empirical evidence and also scientific questions about the nature of volatile gas underground. he finally said because he actually heard me, ""maybe your right about fracking being harmful and dangerous and maybe the information I have been fed is incorrect or biased."" he eventually said. but the time he spent with me those few years i rented from his was only one or two days a year. If you did a statistical study of him and Hickenloopers time, they spend more time hanging out with and raising money with corporate power. And he had little time to investigate things from a fresh perspective on his own in a scientific and rational way. Therefore the corporate influence is not always the outer apparent power of giving candidates money and outwardly bribing them to pass bills in your interests (and that does happen) but the influence of corporations is much more how they infest the government with their interests over the peoples interests in a tactful and more duplicitous way. To get money out of politics means that the politicians will spend more time with the people and therefore will be more influenced by the people and represent them, and less influencable by corporations like the oil companies who even know about Human caused climate change but then who make false science to say there is no climate change to just keep their destructive business model going. Goverment has to be independent of corporate influences. And in most places the fracking corporations have been able to override the local decisions baring fracking. If you watch Gasland you can see that the way power is set up right now when something is harming people it is actually too late when people find out it is bad, and to create the government regulations to stop it. The cooperate first does the bad things and years and years later people might be able to stop it, but its too late. Especially in climate change.and in how our lives are shaped we need government to support the peoples power to shape our own destiny. In terms of climate change we need to act faster and have real independent real science and real people power changing things, we cannot leave that up to the crony capitalistic corporate money greed interests to. The same goes for the military industrial complex and their selling of weapons and so on. We cannot have greed and corporations and military getting us into wars and all that. We need to put the power back into the interests of the people.",2016-02-06T14:20:06Z

And the media just acts like Hillary is the only real player in town. 
Americans, please don't vote for Hillary just because she is a woman. She has many shitty ideas and is pretty conservative and will probably push your security state even further. And you shouldn't vote for Trump either, just because he isn't acting all PC. I know it's very appealing to actually hear somebody in the political theater to speak like that and not like a snake, but please he's not going to help you and because the US is so immensely powerful the whole world is going to suffer the consequences for your voting. 

Generally, to anybody who listens, yes it is your country and it's your right to vote on anybody you see fit to enter your office but keep in mind, you have a huge influence on the rest of the world and consider that if you want to elect your next leader because you're not just voting for yourselves.

The concept of 'free' education, healthcare and all the rest is a lie to win your vote. Why? Because the government will use YOUR money to pay for this 'free' stuff, by increasing your taxes. All three democrat candidates support tax increase for the middleclass and up (fact). Did you really think you will recieve all this for free? In what world do you live? 

So if, in the near future, your country's president is Sanders or Hitlery, and you are working an 8 hour shift of which benefits you have to pay more than 50% in taxes (also because the increased government size costs TRILLIONS and will be paid with YOUR tax money), all the non-working welfare people willbe very thankful of you. 

This being said, if you are going to vote democrat, than that's totally fine! Please vote for Bernie and NOT for Hitlery, because Hitlery will destroy your country more than Obama (who has accumilated the debt towards 20 TRILLION, and divided  you amongst race, political preference, and increased the unemployment of black people to more than 20%).

The government should not have to care for us from cradle to grave. That should not be the role of a government, but it should be the role of the people. Take for instance healthcare. The government's role in one's life should be to ensure freedom and liberty. But healthcare should be our own responsibility. And for those who cannot care for themselves, through no fault of their own, should be cared for by their fellow man, out of human decency, out of humanity, out of love. Before we had government healthcare and all the bureaucracy that followed with it, how did the poor obtain healthcare in the United States? It was provided by charities, by churches, by friends and family members. Doctors would care for them for free, pro-bono. No one allowed anyone to suffer needlessly. There were many religious doctors and people with a soul, with a conscience, that even devoted their lives to care for the poor and not for monetary gain. And the cost of healthcare and insurance back then was a fraction of what it is now. The reason why education and healthcare is so expensive in this country is because of unintended consequences from decisions made with the very best of intentions. I'll try to give a short and practical explanation. If the easy and free credit for student loans dried out today, and no one could take out a loan to attend a good college, you would see empty colleges. And colleges then would either be forced to go out of business, or lower their costs and expenses. Today you see colleges adding building to building, facility after facility, like a nuclear arms race, to attract students and their extremely hefty loans that make them a tremendous profit. All of this unnecessary waste and spending would be eliminated, and education would again be affordable. But even online schools with a fraction of the operating cost of a brick and mortar school charge almost the same amount. And why? Because they can, and who wouldn't if they were in their position, if the people are willing to take out an enormous loan and pay for it.",2016-01-28T13:16:20Z

2016-01-26T05:30:29Z,@cbarcus,ti2Nokoq1J4,"What a wonderful debate!

Lots of great and even inspiring comments from all of the participants. 

Sanders is the angry democratic-socialist activist who tended to repeat himself while accusing various institutions of conspiracy and corruption from the beginning to the very end. At times I enjoyed his passion, even if his ideas are not particularly well sorted out. Definitely the least presidential in my view, but he still made important contributions to the debate.

""It is beyond my comprehension how we can elect a president of the United States, somebody like Trump, who believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.""

O'Malley spoke on the importance of cooperation and opportunity:

‚ÄúWe cannot keep talking past each other, declaring all Republicans are our enemies. We are one. Our cause is one.‚Äù

""The greatest business opportunity to come to America is climate change.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on the threshold of a new era of American progress.‚Äù

""If Donald Trump wants to start a registry in our country of people by faith, he can start with me. I will sign up as one who is totally opposed to his fascist appeals that want to vilify Muslim Americans.‚Äù


But Clinton nailed it. She is by far the most experienced and capable of these candidates, and it is clear that she is committed to improving our nation. Too bad she did not get a chance to talk about climate, but she is giving important support to nuclear power.

‚ÄúI will go anywhere to meet with anyone at any time to find common ground.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want us to defend and build on the affordable care act and improve it.‚Äù

""There needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.""

""But the fact is, we have the Affordable Care Act. That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.""

""Because maybe you can't only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party, but who knows. If you're successful there, maybe you can build even more. That's what I would do.""

""The Dodd-Frank bill and then to sign it was one of the most important regulatory schemes we've had since the 1930s. So I'm going to defend Dodd- Frank and I'm going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the financial industry and getting results.""

""Well, I'm very proud of the Iran Nuclear Agreement. I was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office. I was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed which put the pressure on Iran. It brought them to the negotiating table which resulted in this agreement.""",2016-01-26T05:30:29Z

2016-01-21T12:37:25Z,@WallStwizkid,ti2Nokoq1J4,"Sanders wants to know why we're spending more money on healthcare? It's because the Affordable Care Act required private insurance companies to insure people regardless of their medical history. By absorbing more risk, insurance companies have raised premiums across the board (even the premiums healthy people pay). The ACA isn't nearly as good as Clinton touts it. On that one feature alone, one could argue it's a disaster. The reason why Sanders is right on healthcare is very simple: single-payer is a single-buyer environment. Most people are familiar with monopolies: a single seller environment which usually results in higher prices. Berniecare is essentially a monopsony: a single buyer environment that results in lower prices. In this case, the only buyer is the government. Of course this will lower healthcare costs for people.

It cuts out all the middle men(Insurances, Drug Companies etc) who inflate the prices of health care. Infact citizens don't have to worry about deductibles or any fees. All you gotta to do is go to your doctor or hospital when your sick. Doctors don't have to worry about how much it costs. They are paid wages like anyone else. The single payer is paid for by either federal government or state by putting a levy on taxes or fuel which in turn is enough to pay for all your medicines and treatment.

He said the big banks need to be broken up but all of his solutions point to temporary fixes at the cost of even the middle class. To me that is false advertising for someone who built their campaign talking about change and doing things differently. Hillary may have gotten money from big banks but that doesn't mean that she's incapable of making her own decisions. but time and time again Sanders is continuing to be exposed on his inconsistencies.

Its the about the choices an individual makes. The 77% that everyone wants you to believe is the gender pay gap is false since they are taking the median from all full time jobs in the country. That is like comparing a male engineers' salary to a female elementary school teachers' salary. There has been research done (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis) that shows that women earn about 95% of what a man earns for the same job. The other 5% wage gap is caused by two factors. The first is that women are much less likely to negotiate their salaries compared to their male counterparts (There are numerous experiments published that show this, you can find them on the internet). The second is that women are more often than not the primary nurturers of a families children. They are not able to fully commit to their work whereas men can do so more often.
That leaves leaves only a slim possibility that women have lower wages due to gender discrimination.",2016-01-20T04:35:37Z

Seriously, can someone make a 10h clip of this? Hillary knows best who to listen to for money!


Anyway, she shouldn't focus all her effort on causing conflict with Bernie. The way she gets worked up and uses all her time to try and discredit Bernie just shows that she has no idea what to focus on, and that she knows her ship is sinking and just wants to drag him in as well. She will never become president, when her smug face every time she feels she's in the right consistently inspires real disgust, especially when you consider that she's so inconsistent, and just copies any position she feels will get her elected, since it's getting Bernie many followers.

Her constant bitching and twisting of facts cause Bernie to have to defend himself, rather than concisely informing those who don't know about him and his truly sincere concerns for the USA (Something her over-coached, smug and snide speaking style proves she doesn't have.). Maybe people will get so sick of it that O'Malley wins out.",2016-01-20T00:28:33Z

I guess from looking at the comments people don't understand how much is at stake in this election.  People act like their life is horrible, but people are actually in a pretty good place right now and if we get a democrat in there things will get even better...

People seem to be confident in thinking there is no difference between the democrats and republicans... Seriously Bernie?!?

Sanders will grill him in debates and can win. Hillary will lose in debates and that will change public perception that Trump is more stronger candidate to be commander in chief and strong to deal with guys like Putin.

There are eight levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.
The first is the most important.
 
Healthcare‚Äì Control healthcare and you control the people.
Poverty ‚Äì Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.
Debt ‚Äì Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.
Gun Control ‚Äì Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state
Welfare ‚Äì Take control of every aspect of their lives. (Food, Housing, and Income)
Education ‚Äì Take control of what people read and listen to us‚Äú take control of what children learn in school.
Religion ‚Äì Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.
Class Warfare ‚Äì Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.",2016-01-19T07:19:55Z

If¬†Mr. Sanders was a little bit younger - let's say in his early 50's, without a shadow of a doubt he'd beat Hillary Clinton and would be the next President for 2017. I, as a Bernie Sanders supporter who has monetarily donated my li'l measly $250 to his campaign as a working class citizen, just hate that he waited until he got in latter years of his life to run. That being said, we may be seeing another Clinton in The White House unfortunately. And the only thing Martin O'Malley has going for himself is that he's a good looking, polished guy appearance-wise -- otherwise, he's simply a candidate of no concrete substance whatsoever; he seemingly struggles noticeably to answer questions related to policies when posed to him and he tries too hard to win over voters' votes and in debates, inspires to anew and accumulate cheers from the audience. Why he's still in this presidential race is utterly mind-boggling. Conclusively though, NBC couldn't have chosen better moderators than Lester Holt and Andrea Mitchell-- they were exceptionally awesome at the duty and weren't too pushy with the candidates.",2016-01-19T04:57:09Z

We pay more than other industrialized countries because the health care is government-run in those countries. The government is not going to operate solely on a for-profit basis like an insurance company will. It's all pretty simple. Obamacare sucks balls because of the mandate and penalty. We're forced to buy insurance from some¬†multinational conglomerate¬†and if we choose to opt-out we have to pay a penalty? What exactly are they doing with this¬†money?¬†That part goes too far.

Because we don't watch fox news. Because we don't buy into the commercial cover ups. We READ. We search. We decide what is right. Acting like more tax is horrible is the corporations becoming squeamish at the idea of CEOS having to rethink that month vacation or major bonus to themselves.

I honestly see her as a shape-shifting reptilian who transforms herself and her beliefs the very moment it becomes to her advantage. It disgusts me.

Oh, and it's obvious the people on the panel were in favor of Hillary. They were basically working together with her in an attempt to demonize and destroy Bernie and his credibility.  And in fact, it seems main point of this debate was to capitalize on Hillary's supposed 'strengths' as well as Bernie's supposed 'weaknesses'.",2016-01-19T02:51:03Z

Everyone I know have no form of racism whatsoever. 

2. We (America) has many programs to get people off addictions of drugs and what not, so why is it that the candidates are speaking as if there is no such thing. And wouldn't you think that the people who wanted off the addictions they have would try to go somewhere for help? There is a decent number of places where I live that would help those with addictions for free.

3. Wouldn't raising minimum wage cause inflation, and cause a major loss in jobs? Because in order to raise minimum wage, businesses would have to raise there price so that way they can pay there employees or they would have to lay off thousands.",2016-01-19T02:19:29Z

After the cold war, the US seems to have been fixated on non socialist views, because people feel it is somehow unpatriotic to support equality, gun control or healthcare , as socialism is on the same side of the political spectrum as our great enemy communism. Even though I wont be supporting any democrats, i still get annoyed when people accuse them of being ""damn socialist"" or ""communists"" or ""soviets"". If people think what Sanders is doing is communism, then people should seriously take a history or economics lesson, and learn that wanting more equality is a far cry from Soviet Russia or North Korea.

The end of the ""industrial economy"" was supposed to be the beginning of the ""information economy"" which means, a lot less work, a lot more pay and all kinds of free benefits. After Bill Clinton we had the money to do it all, free schools, free medicine, free transportation. This was supposed to happen back in 2000. 

People say we gave away our jobs to China. We did! On purpose!. We were supposed to let them do the heavy work and we were supposed to use all the riches we had attained to create a new economy and society. A true, paid for America. 

When you hear that we lost 9 trillion, it's true. We didn't lose it, it was taken from us, but it was there! it still is! We were supposed to be the Microsoft of the world, leading ion all freedoms and medicine and infrastructure and switching to non fossil fuels, all of that. Don't let anyone say we don't have the money, we do. Find the 9 trillion first and bring those who took it to justice. 

And as much as I like Bernie, he'll never be able to do what he wants to do. Hillary (and Bill) can, because they are part of the ""system"", they are respected by the ""system"" and they are somewhat on our side too. Just like Obama they know how to walk that fine line to get things done. They know that if they push too much or too hard, the system won't allow them to do anything. This is what we need, just until we make up the 9 trillion. Anyone even thinking of voting republican are either blind, stupid or part of the anti-American changes they want.

Our team won the debate. Moderators included hospital executives, insurance company managers, and health care administration faculty. I've now worked in both mental health and now work for the leading hospital in Orange County/Newport Beach.

Our nation wants to make money off the sick, that system does not work. For profit healthcare should be completely dismantled and we must begin to service the sick AT COST - AND NOT INFLATED COSTS AS PROFIT. That is why Bernie can quote a triple cost of healthcare over the other industrialized nations. 

The wealthy in America have INVADED healthcare and merely set up many systems to get paid. When you get sick, the rich are getting richer, through inflated pricing. When you pay your monthly healthcare premium, the rich are getting richer. Even those higher deductibles that state insurance companies do not have to kick in money for your health, the rich are getting richer.

Gun reform, ObamaCare (which is a disaster), etc. The 2nd amendment doesn't clarify what type of gun a citizen has the right to carry, because it was intended to protect citizens from an overpowered government, which is what were leaning to now. What happens when no citizen has military grade weapons (M-4), and then the police do not have military grade weapons. That leaves the government to only have those weapons. What happens when the government goes rogue, more than it has, and the citizens are left to defend themselves. It would be impossible. 

Also, they constantly want to raise minimum wage. Why? That will only increase prices on every consumable, and most people's wage won't go up. So that electrician who worked hard to gain that $15/hr wage, he will be making the same as some entry level burger flipper (Mind you, is intended as a high school job, not to raise a family).

2016-01-18T17:35:19Z,,ti2Nokoq1J4,"""The GOP-authored bill was crafted as a response to a proposal from ex-Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Brooksley Born to ramp up oversight of derivatives. But the version Sanders initially voted for was more benign than the final, Gramm-authored version, and it didn't draw any of the protests that the 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagall did. In October 2000, the bill passed the House by a vote of 377 to 4 (51 members didn't vote), and then sat on the shelf for weeks.

But in December, Gramm -- after¬†coordinating¬†with top Clinton administration officials -- added much harder-edged deregulatory language to the bill, then attached the entire package to a must-pass 11,000-page bill funding the entire federal government. After Gramm's workshopping, the legislation included new language saying the federal government ""shall not exercise regulatory authority with respect to, a covered swap agreement offered, entered into, or provided by a bank."" That ended all government oversight of derivatives purchased or traded by banks. He also created the so-called ""Enron Loophole,"" which barred federal oversight of energy trading on electronic platforms.

Sanders has since hammered the CFMA, its architects and specific provisions in Senate hearings and on the Senate floor. He helped push through legislation to close the Enron loophole in 2008. He voted against the bank bailouts of 2008, and has¬†cried foul¬†on heavy Wall Street speculation in the derivatives market for oil, saying it needlessly drives up gas prices. He has voted to break up the largest banks, and supports reinstating the Depression-era firewall between conventional lending and risky securities trading.""

Now we give a tax break to companies who ship production overseas (Republicans voted twice against reversing that).

All of these candidates are way too left. If you are 18-24 and are currently working, even if it is a minimum wage job, there is about a 50% chance that you will lose that job if one of the candidates on this stage get elected. If I was a small business owner, like a local restaurant, and I had to all of a sudden had to pay my employees double, one of two things would happen. Either I would raise my prices and risk losing business and possibly shutting down, or laying off approximately half of my staff and hope that the half that I keep are good enough to keep my business up and running. I have made it through college and am working as an engineer. My wife is a stay at home mom because it doesn't make financial sense to have our daughter in day care. So we are a family of four living on a single income. If these wages go up, you could have a young couple, who didn't graduate high school, flipping burgers at McDonalds, with a higher household wage than we have. The entire Democratic platform is about equality, especially income equality. How is this equal? How does the person that put his money and time into getting a higher education, all of a sudden penalized because of a class of 18-24 year olds who think things should be given to them instead of working for them. Instead of jacking up the minimum wage, how about we improve the subsidies for day care facilities so working moms and dads can have a place to take their children so they can continue to work to improve their lives. We have to stop treating service industry jobs as careers.¬†I should never see someone older than 30 working at a fast food place. Those are jobs you get when you are in high school, or to help pay your way through college. They are jobs you grow out of. I'm worried that increasing minimum wage will just make it more convenient for people to be stagnant. Why go to college and spend that kind of money to get a job where I may make almost the same as a bus boy?",2016-01-18T16:14:19Z

Why? There's more money for the establishment and private sector with the 2nd best option.

Mainstream Media has just as much influence as the corrupt Campaign Finance System. Though, their sway is slowly dwindling, thankfully. We should create a State-run news agency for circumstances just such as these: electoral debates and political speeches, so that they can be presented to the American people in an unbiased light. Oh, I know what you're thinking, 'State-run! What are you, a communist? That's a slippery slope!' No, I'm just a concerned citizen who would rather see a State-run news agency than an Oligarchic-big brother, run by the top 1% of 1%. Trust me, Stephen Burke and others don't want what's best for you. We wouldn't regulate the news agencies that already exist. We'd just create an additional one, run by an unaffected, third party; and it would only be used for situations such as this. Wait, don't we have something like that? Isn't it called C-SPAN? Yet, we agree to sell our political debates out? W. T. F.

2016-01-18T14:38:28Z,@DaquanDumas,ti2Nokoq1J4,"As a non-American this is my view on this: Bernie Sanders should be president. 

He's the only one that really gets it and wants to stand up against big money. Huge corporations and lobbygroups are deciding things in the US instead of the people. It doesn't matter if you get Clinton in the white house. she'll keep doing what Obama and Bush were doing. Listening to the people that gave them money because they are in the pocket of their backers. This is the main issue in American politics and Sanders is running without the backing of these big corporations and shady lobby groups. He's running on the money his own voters are donating. So he's no nobody's pocket.

This is also a reason a lot of people are voting on Trump but the only problem with Trump is that he's a radical. Bernie wants to bring change with logic and actual plans while  Trump is just screaming that he will change things but he has no real sollutions. He'll only make enemies and bully them. Trump is also dangerous because he's a billionaire himself. He's got a lot of personal financial stakes. He also comes across as a power hungry person. (this is my own subjective view). It's a man that names buildings after himself and is overly arrogant. You really don't think he cares about the working class right? I really don't get why certain republicans vote for him when they are in the working class themselfs. He doesn't care about their rights. 

The main thing Sanders has got against him is that people in the US don't understand democratic socialism and they link it with communism. While it has nothing to do with communism. A lot of countries in Europe are democratic solcialist countries. They still run on capitalistic values but they've got rights in their constitution that insure healthcare for every citizen for example.",2016-01-18T14:38:28Z

At this moment I feel he's the right man for the job. As for Hillary, I never supported her the last time she ran for president and I sure as hell won't support her now. She did bring up an interesting point about drug use. But that's the only one. Anyone who hasn't been under a rock should know about her relationship with wall street. She doesn't care about anything other than making history as the 1st woman president. I doubt she'd even be running if that historical spot was already filled. For the moment Bernie Sanders has my vote for president. We do need better Health Care no one will deny it. We need actual affordable health care, one where preexisting conditions don't matter and where gender and age don't matter either. The fines for not having health care need to go away. Having health care shouldn't be a law it should be a human right. Then there's O'Malley, I keep forgetting his name! I just refer to him as the other guy. He's not memorable to say the least nor was I moved or impressed with anything he said other than sustainable energy. But having to wait till 2050 for his plan to be in full effect is insane to say the least. We do need a long term shift like that but we also need a short term one to get us through till then. For a leader of this country we don't need more of the same; as anyone should be able to see it's not working. Our country is hanging by a thread, it's damn near an oligarchy. If you aren't a millionaire, then you're one illness, injury, or flat tire away from being homeless; and this has to end. If Sanders becomes president I truly believe he's the leader this country needs right now.",2016-01-18T13:46:11Z

But you have no right to forget what she has said earlier when popular opinion made different demands. In an interview with Larry King, she said, ""there is no Left in the Clinton White House."" Of welfare, she remarked: ""Our liberal friends are just going to understand that we are going to go for welfare reform - for eliminating the welfare entitlement. They are just going to have to get used to it. I'm not going to listen to them or be sympathetic to them."" Seeing through her perpetual lies is so easy. You just have to be willing to look.

He wants to serve all people in society, and he knows that this requires complete independence from the 1%ers. So, who are you going to trust? The person who takes money from the health corporations, and suddenly doesn't want universal healthcare by the government? Or the person who's been fighting for it for 40 years, and will kick the profit-making insurance companies out of mass health provision? Profiting from sick people is immoral, as well as inefficient. The rest of the industrialised world doesn't do it, because they recognise that healthcare is too important to be left to the profit motive.",2016-01-18T12:14:15Z

The dinosaur mainstream media in America is completely biased in support of Clinton but they are no longer able to fool the people. The mind control is breaking down, the people are waking up.

2016-01-18T10:09:42Z,@DesertStateInEU,ti2Nokoq1J4,"The level of ignorance among leftists is staggering, but not at all surprising. The only explanation to why comrade Sanders has supporters at all is that his supporters are even dumber than he is.
He understands the economy like a chimp, he has a non existent foreign policy, and he doesnt even have leadership skills. His top socialist utopias that he keeps yapping away about can be destroyed with a few simple facts. Denmark debt/capita $101 000, Sweden $91 000 and BOTH have a declining population. They dont even have to maintain a big military like the US to keep world peace. Massive debt, sky high taxes, sky high gas prices, declining population, small military and STILL failing.
And then theres my personal experience that ALL of the hardcore socialists Ive talked to in the past few years admitted that the only reason they support socialism is because it leads to communism. And these were real hardcore socialists/marxists that sent me entire essays explaining why communism is good, also they talked like college professors.
Inb4 any indoctrinated leftist drone starts raging at me on how hes a democratic socialist, socialism vs democratic socialism is like bullshit vs sugar coated bullshit. And make no mistake based on what he said, he is in fact a socialist.
Also what will happen when he weakens the US military to be able to pay for all that free money he wants to throw around? Im sure Crimea2 wont happen in the Baltics. And China building new islands in the pacific? Naah. But if the Baltics are invaded its ww3. Brought to you by comrade Sanders.
Or how about his irrational plan to tie the police's hands behind their backs when it comes to black criminals? Im sure that wont result in skyrocketing crime rates due to black criminals that no longer have to fear getting killed by the police no matter what they do right? And which race makes up the majority of the victims of black criminals? Blacks themselves.
Lets recap what we have so far. Chimp understanding of the economy, non existent foreign policy, $10/gallon gas like in his top socialist utopias and skyrocketing crime rates. I only feel sorry for the poor indoctrinated cant think for themselves leftist snowflakes that support Bernie Bolshevik Sanders.

Hillary is poised, has specific plans (that are not changed 2 hours before a debate), has the experience to actually say what she means/ has witnessed and answers her questions fully and eloquently. She does not make grandiose promises about social revolutions of millions to overthrow the evil rich: instead, she talks of progress, feasible progress, working with the right end, building on progress made - and being strategic.

Frankly, I think he's to old to finish his term and he's getting the younger vote because sadly many young people are very impressionable.  How does he think he can accomplish what others have tired for decades and failed!  He's just yelling, complaining about wall street and the wealthy, but  hasn't produced a formulated plan to fix it. He's the that's all talk and no show!  And, lets be clear... he's more back paddling then any of the candidates;  e.g. last debate ""No Tax"" increase on the middle class, this debate the middle class will be taxed.  Doesn't sound like much of a solution when the middle class is already struggling.  TAX THE WEALTHY... get it all done with higher taxes on them and leave the middle class alone.  Hilary stated has numerous times, she will not execute her policies at the expense of the middle class.... all I can say, the majority of what Bernie is promising will not happen and then the country will be hating him just has people turned on President Obama.",2016-01-18T09:00:31Z

Sanders would get in there and scream and shout, get no support and be impotent for the remainder of his term because he is not pragmatic. He's an ideologue. I want a sly person who thinks ten steps ahead of her opponents. I like Sanders but he does not have the personal qualities, I think we need right now. we need a pragmatic fighter, not a visionary warrior.

For example, they want funding to research the mating habits of beavers, so they create a paper called, ""the mating habits of beavers and its effects on climate change"" and voila!  they get their slice of the taxpayer dollar funding!

Hilary says whatever she thinks will be received best, and is calculating in terms of her career. She only comes around on progressive issues when the majority have come to support it. Bernie, however, says what he thinks is true and best, and doesn't seem to care if others haven't come around yet. There are a few examples of Bernie being ahead of the game, in terms of progressive values, and Hilary being late to the game. Also, to be fair, Elizabeth Warren shares Bernie's authentic dedication to progressive values, and if she had run, I would have been torn between her and Bernie.

ISIS and other terror groups are a huge issue and threat to us, and we will need soldiers in the region, weather a small force of special OPs troops to act as a counter effort against their operations or a larger police force there to ensure those terrorists dont leave their home nations, but I think we really should STOP training, arming, and supporting these regimes in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia is committing Human Rights violations and he is NOT alone. 

We failed to keep thousands of people safe from their own crazed dictator and his chemical weapons(Which are illegal according to the Geneva convention) even though we said we would act! We are too weak with this. 

If someone attacks us, they must die. We cant allow anyone to threaten our lifestyles, homes, and people. 

As for Russia, why are we still enemies with them? The cold war ended. The Russian people are very similar to us, yet we still treat them as the old Red Menace. The USSR and the Warsaw Pact fell, yet we held on to NATO(The organization to counter the Warsaw Pact). We need to disband NATO and start working WITH Russia instead of against them.

Hence 20 years of Reagan, and zero NON Reagan-tied republican administrations since) left us with since the 80's.

These democrats always create these new giveaway programs and say the rich will pay for them, but it's always the middle class that foots the bill in higher taxes.

I think Bernie is a sincere guy that has good intentions, but socialism has been proven to be a failed system. Look what happened to the USSR when they tried socialism, the kids were eating bread and water for lunch at school. Socialism sounds good on paper, but it always leads to collapse in the end. When you start taking from the rich and giving to the poor, eventually everyone is poor. We need to get Trump elected and bring back our high paying manufacturing jobs from China, Mexico, Japan etc. We need someone like him that knows how to deal with financial matters and make our country rich like it used to be. Hillary is funded big time by several corporations like Wal Mart and Tyson foods. Wal Mart doesn't want Trump putting tariffs on their Chinese made crap, because they would be forced to buy American goods where people are paid a decent salary. Tyson foods, which employees tens of thousands of illegals in their chicken slaughter houses, doesn't want a wall to keep out their cheap labor from Mexico and central America. If that happened they would have to offer a higher salary to attract America workers, because American people won't do grueling factory jobs for 8 bucks an hour like the illegals will. We need to stop these illegals that have driven down wages and ruined much of our economy. Used to be that housing construction jobs were high paying, but since the illegals flooded in, construction jobs don't pay much anymore.",2016-01-18T07:11:01Z

But you have no right to forget what she has said earlier when popular opinion made different demands. In an interview with Larry King, she said, ""there is no Left in the Clinton White House."" Of welfare, she remarked: ""Our liberal friends are just going to understand that we are going to go for welfare reform - for eliminating the welfare entitlement. They are just going to have to get used to it. I'm not going to listen to them or be sympathetic to them."" Seeing through her perpetual lies is so easy. You just have to be willing to look.

I was chosen at random to lead the opposition side against the Affordable Care Act to amend it and not repeal it and our team won. Moderators included those from the hospital industry such as Memorial Care Hospitals, Insurance Companies, and Health Care Administration faculty. When you look at Bernie Sanders approach to driving down cost that are associated with the hospital master charge bill sent to insurance & government run health plans there  has  been a steady increase in those charges. The reason being is that private insurance continues to exist and will always pass it off to the consumer in the form of price toward higher premiums, co-pays, and prescription drug pricing. I've worked in both mental health care and now for the leading hospital in Orange County so I've seen both sides of the payer system. If you believe an individual who looks down every time she lies (that's called reading body language presentation in mental health) then I feel very sorry for the American future that my children will be a part of( I don't have them yet as I'm only 25). I only wish that I could have been one of the video questions to ask all the candidates actual hard questions from the real experience I've been involved with on multiple sides of the healthcare industry. Please for all our sake look towards the future and don't extend your willing vote for a sub par democratic candidate that is backed by big banks and secular media coercion. Please vote Sanders in for president of the United States of America! P.S. The scholarship money I won from the healthcare debate only paid for half of my tuition.

On top of that, he's an admitted Socialist which is just a step away from Communism, as Vladimir Lenin so humbly demonstrated in the USSR. 

For those that don't know, Bernie went to Communist Soviet Union for his honeymoon during the cold war era to study their social systems. Before that he went to Socialist/Communist Nicaragua while the US was at war with them to learn from their Socialist, Revolutionary, felon President (whom Bernie hailed as a good person). Around the same time he also gave praise to Cuba's Fidel Castro for educating the children and transforming their society for the better... though thousands upon thousands of refugees have fled from Cuba over the span of decades due to oppressive government and lack of opportunity. (This is all true. All of these videos are also on youtube to see, go search them)

This guy truly is looking for a revolution and should be strongly compared to the Democratic Socialist, turned Marxist/Communist, Vladimir Lenin. This is how these types of societies begin, people. Someone feeds into the fears of a class warfare and then encourages a 'positive' revolution that slowly changes over time. Remember, once you give Government power, they don't like giving it back! Bernie wants to slowly put the power and money under Government control. Starting with healthcare and college plans.

Hilary won't do anything to change that, she doesn't have a good plan like Bernie, also accusing Bernie of going against Obama when he said he actually supported him, that's low class Hilary. Bernie for president, this guy has guts of going against the powerful people, I hope he doesn't get assassinated like JFK.",2016-01-18T05:23:44Z

2016-01-18T05:14:45Z,@johnpieloio5313,ti2Nokoq1J4,"Whether Democrat or Republican, people are fed up with candidates beholden to the richest most powerful special interests in the country that are hellbent on reducing the standard of living of ordinary Americans. As Bernie pointed out, Goldman Sachs support both Dems and Republians and it doesnt matter to them who wins as long as a corrupt candidate wins. That leaves us with Bernie Sanders and Trump. While I commend Trump for bringing up the issue of the corrupt campaign finance system in America, Trump is his own special interest, a NY yuppie who has made it loud and clear that he will give himself and his family huge tax breaks while giving crumbs to the people. He's ready to shower his billionaire friends with gifts once in office.

Sanders is a straight shooter, a man who for 40 years has fought for the little guy against every special interest in Washington. He has always made it clear he will rip up these anti-American trade deals that benefit the rich donor class, and has been a strong advocate of investing in America and the quality of life of Americans, not foreign adventures and corporate welfare. His integrity and consistency is second to none. That's why I'm voting for Bernie Sanders.",2016-01-18T05:14:45Z

That alone has too much impact and does not allow candidates to be elected based on quality and merit. Also, O'Malley shouldn't be thinking about creating laws based on his own emotion. Sure that little boy was in a bad situation where the drug dealers shot up the barber shop, but I doubt those drug dealers got that weapon at an authorized dealer. The main point here is that you shouldn't be making laws based on your own emotions and experiences.",2016-01-18T05:14:06Z
