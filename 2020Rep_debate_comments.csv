J&J's baby lotion has been stripped of harmful ingredients that were known to cause health issues including the loss of lives. The lotion doesn't have that famous new born baby smell/scent that was loved by so many ppl including those that have no children. Their baby powder was pulled from the shelves of stores only after law siuts were filed and won,  as a result, of women diagnosed with cervical cancer. If, I'm not mistaken I believe that the CEO is incarcerated for knowingly adding opiates to their weght loss products/medications. Please correct me if I'm wrong about the name of the company responsible for the opiate scandal, but I'm alnost positive that the baby lotion and powder were products that raised concerns of millions of parents and adults  with no children but also used them.  

The Merderma company has allegedly damaged little girls with their vaccination for teen agers to prevent cervical cancer. I'm thinking off the top of my head, but I think the vax was to prevent something called PPV if I'm correct. I do know it's given to teenagers and many girls have loss their right to have babies and some have loss their lives boys and girls. I don't trust any of those companies because they've known the dangers of humanity consuming their poison but for large profit margins they neglected their number one consumers.

Under his tenure, before the pandemic, the lowest unemployment level he achieved is 3.5% in November of 2019, according to the Federal Reserve. Not bad. But, under Calvin Coolidge‚Äôs presidency, the unemployment rate dropped to 1.6% in 1926, handily beating Trump‚Äôs performance by a respectable spread of 1.9 basis-points. Then again, during Eisenhower‚Äôs stewardship of the economy, the unemployment level dropped _below_ 3.5% to 2.5% in the Summer of 1953, beating Trump‚Äôs number by 1% ‚Äì not much, but to say ‚Äúthe best unemployment numbers in the history of the country‚Äù is nothing but hogwash, and this puts into question almost any other claim he makes. There are plenty of other times when the unemployment level has equaled or been better than Trump's performance. People lie, numbers don't.",2020-10-25T06:41:13Z

Support Joe Biden The American people will not regret it.
Donald Trump knows and lies to his own people!
Coronavirus (COVID -19) is NOT a VIRUS, but a BACTER that causes death. This leads to the formation of blood clots and the death of the patient. Because COVID-19 has been proven to thicken the blood, stimulating a person to develop thrombosis. Because the blood is not saturated with oxygen, so it thickens, and the flow in the heart and lungs slows down, the person cannot breathe and dies quickly.
They opened the Body, and realized that the veins had dilated and clotted the blood, that all the veins and arteries were full of blood clots that interfered with normal blood flow, transporting oxygen to all organs, mainly the brain, heart and lungs, and the patient eventually died‚Ä¶
Why ? The American people must not know the truth.
Due to the procedure, the burial of people with coronavirus is immediately delivered to the cemetery in a tin box that must be welded.",2020-10-25T03:29:54Z

I sent the attached file: ( The earth belongs to Allah ) This Is The Link : 
( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OELmaJqTOuq4it-dmakqhsgzcT9qqIgR/view?usp=sharing ) to many idolatry temples in the world via the regular mail and online , and I will keep sending it and urging the real believers in Allah to send it until Allah concludes a predetermined matter, but before you read it I would like to talk to you‚Ä¶ the politicians ( policymakers ) in Western society and in the same time to all people in Western society through this message , My words with you will be a four questions I will ask you and I will answer them on your behalf. 
My first question is: Are you against violence and hatred speech and the factors and motives that incite violence and hatred?? Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!! 
My second question is: Are you a supporters and encouragers of so-called personal freedoms, freedom of demonstrations, and freedom of expression of opinions, freedom of religions, equality between men and women and same sex marriage?? Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!! 
My third question is: Is the death penalty abolished from your judicial systems because you consider it as a savage barbaric act and not suited to the contemporary man?? Your answer is: of course it is!... absolutely yes!!
My fourth and final question is: What do you do to the murderers? Where do you place them?? Do you put them in a resorts you call it jails!! in order to eat the best food and to exercise sports and to practice fitness on the latest sports equipments, and to watch TV and to use the Internet and to read books, magazines and newspapers in their clean place which equipped with a central heating and cooling all the times, and always you provide them a health care at all levels, And from time to time you supply them a new outerwear and underwear and pyjamas and perfumes and new shoes, and you protect them around the clock ,and no anybody has the right to touch them badly at all or to threaten them or to abuse them physically or verbally ,and nobody has the right even to annoying them or to disturb them at any time ,and on top of all of that they are not demanded to pay a cent for the costs of that wonderful life, but in fact the families of their victims are demanded to pay the costs for all of that from their own looted money which you call it TAX?? Your answer is: of course we do!... absolutely yes!!  
Well.... according to your answers, it is very clear and it is very obvious that Without a feeling, and without noticing, and unintentionally you are the ones who definitely creating the environment for the existence of violence, hatred and crimes, and you are the ones who inciting and encouraging all of that to be existed continuously and to be spread and to be exacerbated. 
Now listen carefully what I am going to say ‚Ä¶..
Allah is the Lord of the worlds, and he is the Creator of the worlds, and all the human beings are one of His creations, Allah has graciously revealed His mercy to mankind , His mercy is the Religion of Islam ... and the Quran is the Words of Allah which are addressed to all human beings, Quran is a sacred and a Holy words, It is the Constitution from the Creator to the people , The whole Quran is a completed and integrated unit...it is cannot be followed and obeyed some of Quran verses and ignore the rest , in order to please people and to satisfy them!.
The non serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God's constitution in the whole earth means a disbelief in God and a hypocrisy in its clearest form ... and it means the recognition and the acceptance of the existence of crimes in all forms in everywhere...and that will be the reason for the destruction of all human societies in all their differences.
The serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God's constitution in the whole earth means a real protection and a real preservation to all people in everywhere. 
Do you find up to this point that these words inciting violence, hatred and terrorism!?... Or you think the denying of God's existence and to his constitution and to eradicate Islam religion would be the best option and the superior choice ?!.. In order to embrace your laws and to please you and to satisfy you and to avoid your anger and to be that a clear obedience to your laws which inciting the ignorance, crimes and corruption in the whole earth.. Which been created by God.. And which only God own it !! 
Blessed be Allah who says : (( Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that they desire? Who is better than Allah in judgment for people who are certain?)) , Allah is the Lord of the worlds and He is the Dominator to his creatures He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the unbelievers )) , and He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the evildoers )) , and He said: ((Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the sinners)). God does not call for violence and hatred, in fact he encourages and motivates and forces people to live in the earth as He wills...Not to live every person as he likes and wishes ,  Allah is the only Creator...he is our Creator. 
No one can understand the God's Justice and His divine logic except those who have the ability to understand and to think and to conceive through the pure logic. 
God has wrathed and cursed and prepared a terrible punishment to anyone who believes in some of His words and deliberately ignores the rest of them, He said : (( Do you believe in part of the Book and defy another part? So what is the requital of those of you who do that except disgrace in the life of this world? And on the Day of Resurrection, they shall be consigned to the severest punishment. And Allah is not oblivious of what you do))‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

While listening others we have to use our own prudance if You have one!!. Others are not better than us. No one knows anything about this pandamic yet . All predictions so far failed. Ha .. Panic?  If it is , why do you wear big mask always - not because not panic? Mask has 400 times bigger pores than the size of virus . This is said by Dr. Guptha too?
You do not even include China bribes and Ukraine bribes in tax return at all. 
IRS reviews the President's tax return before he became President ? It is the job of IRS to review every ones tax return ? 47 years in Politics made him crooked People to take advantage of disadvantaged good Public and pass the burden to innocent Tax Payers. One is 47 years in Politics and other 4 years Politics . Many thing done in 4 years than which distroyed in 47 years..

When the President was in hospital for day the stock market collapsed ? what will be if he is out? The whole world will be on disarray??
Different states are different in economically advantged levels , so state must decide the minimum to that place even more than $15. No size fit for all.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the budget deficit for fiscal year 2020 would increase to $3.3 trillion or 16% GDP, more than triple that of 2019 and the largest as % GDP since 1945. CBO also forecast the debt held by the public would rise to 98% GDP in 2020, compared with 79% in 2019 and 35% in 2007 before the Great Recession.

Since when is a moderator debating for a presidential election? Still, I am looking into what Trump said about the trillion trees project https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/president-trump-signs-one-trillion-trees-executive-order-promoting-conservation-regeneration-nations-forests/
and the carbon emissions, which are the lowest they have been since before 1993.  I imagine this year 2020 probably will be even lower.   https://www.statista.com/statistics/183943/us-carbon-dioxide-emissions-from-1999/  
This shows you can protect the environment without compromising the economy and jobs.

The executive office of the government is known as the White House, situated in the heart of the nation's capital. The president's cabinet of top officials is chosen by the President, conditional upon the US Senate's approval. Besides the various departments led by Secretaries, other agencies such as the Office of Management and Budget, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Council of Economic Advisers report to the President. In the case of the President's death, the Vice President succeeds to the office.

2020-10-23T21:22:27Z,@Gemini353,RHISJrOODJ4,"TL;DR: If I'd be an US citizen, this debate was pretty helpful to make a decision regarding my vote. I'd probably vote for Trump. 

First, I'm not a US citizen. I'm from Romania, this means some of the intricacies of local politics are unknown to me. I watched both debates out of curiousity and I made up my mind mostly based on these alone. 

No offense to Biden or his supporters, during this session I felt the democrat showed his limits. Unlike the first one where he was constantly trolled by Trump, here he had enough space to express his vision and future plans.

He looked like he forgot his ideas mid sentence, I would guess that's him showing his age. I think if he's elected, someone else would run the country for him. However the incumbent president was on point with his ideas and views, whether one agrees with him or not. So I'd like to vote for the man who actually runs the country, not some  figurehead which will delegate that very important task to someone else. That someone else should run for president themselves if they would want to run the country I'm in üòà

Let's not forget that these two guys are politicians, they're able to lie on camera without flinching, it's in their nature. Neither of them came with a solid plan for the next four years. All they said is that once they're (re)elected they're going to come up with a plan for all discussed topics, which will somehow be better than the opponent's. And each claimed they're right and the other one's wrong which would really mean jack to me ü§§

Can't help notice that if Mr. Biden's performance is now as we saw in the debate, imagine him in a few years, at the end of the term. Sorry to say this but in his state he should enjoy retirement, not run for presidency üòÖ",2020-10-23T21:22:27Z

We have seen the human side of kim jong un. And the west is still trying to condemn them. Very unfair, very politicized.

""When did China get most favored nation status?

In the 1990s, continued ""most favored nation"" status for the People's Republic of China by the United States created controversy because of its sales of sensitive military technology and China's serious and continuous persecution of human rights. China's MFN status was made permanent on December 27, 2001.

What President opened up trade with China?
U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to the People's Republic of China was an important strategic and diplomatic overture that marked the culmination of the Nixon administration's resumption of harmonious relations between the United States and mainland China after years of diplomatic isolation.

What President normalized relations with China?
In order to complete the process of normalization, President Carter dispatched National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski to China to meet with Deng and other leaders. After months of negotiations, in December the two governments finally issued a joint communiqu√© that established full diplomatic relations.

Who ran against George Bush in 2001?

2020-10-23T16:02:36Z,@poitco.52,RHISJrOODJ4,"Think of trump as a kid caught doing something wrong. He has learnt how to talk his way out of trouble no matter the cost.
Where does he get his energy from?? Defending himself. Take away the interrogator-attitude, bring on an actual enlightened attitude, someone who doesn't attack Trump, who doesn't feed him ""bad"" energy, the energy that feeds his ego, take it away and he would drain himself. After watching him for a while, you realise he feeds off defending himself. Take away the attacks and he has no role!
I can't believe there are no ""non-attackers"" in politics, we really need that spiritual-personal transcended politician to guide people how to deal with a situation like that. Someone who allows the negativity to flow by, someone who doesn't ""take it personal"", someone who can actually hold a greater responsibility. Biden did okay, but got reeled into attacking Trump, reeled into Trump's game.
Put a Ghandi, an Eckhart Tolle, a Terrence McKenna, a hippy, literally put a hippy there and see what happens. The system is in dire need of compassion, of leaders who don't attack the traumatised (Trump is heavily traumatised), but rather accept them and present a healthy role model for guidance into a better future. 
Is it possible? Until we see a revolutionary figure in Global politics, who knows...
We've seen Bolsanaro, we've seen Trump, maybe (hopefully) the next wave of political leaders will be Utopian, compassionate, forgiving, guiding, spiritual?
Call me a f*cking hippy, but we all know the world is lacking exactly this and our system's leaders are lacking this - as far as the majority of population are aware of - fear, anger and arguing are the only ways forward! We need compassion, we literally need more ""enlightenment"" in our political systems.
Otherwise we're kinda f*cked if this continues...",2020-10-23T16:10:00Z

It's #disgusting how the #Republicans can convince themselves, with #lies, that these #children don't matter. Supposedly because they've fed themselves the false narrative of, ""they weren't really with their parents.""

Disgusting! #PresidentMiscavige aka #DJSpinMasterTee aka #POTAS #DonaldJTrump #Donald Trump #Trump, has fully brain washed the whole #RepublicanParty. The people who boast about being the party that cares ""most"" about #familyvalues.

I am a #substituteteacher #teacher, in a district with many #Hispanic #immigrants. I mainly love #teaching the littlest ones, madly #kinders through 5th. My favorite is #kindergarten though. 

I have personally met many children who came over, illegally mind you, with their #parents at some point. These children are #amazing, #strong, #intelligent,  #kind, and #courageous #HumanBeings. That's the last I could say about these children. I know they will make the work a better place, and America will help them do it. 

I've already seen #evidence of this in the form of earlier #generations passing down their love and #support. I've met #adults that came over, #illegally mind you, as children, with their parents. These adults are now #legal #citizens, and they work in many different #schooldistricts across America, dedicating their #time and love to help with children they #empathize with. It's #beautiful #beauty to watch. 

The thing is, every American should have loads of #empathy for this situation. We were all children at one point, and America is a nation of #immigrants that prides itself on taking new people in, from #ANYWHERE!!!

We love you #Mexico #Cuba #PuertoRico #CentralAmerica #SouthAmerica #LatinAmerica!!!!

And yes, we love you too #Canada ;)

Y'all need to stop believing everything you hear on the internet. America, wake up! Education has been neglected and gutted for decades now, in hopes to keep us mindless. They were successful, and the evidence is clear to me. 

Everyone is focused on being mad at #Russia right now, for tricking America with disinformation in 2016. The media also tells us to be mad at #Facebook for having #negligence in spreading the #disinformation.

Why isn't anyone more mad about the fact that we have a nation that is so stupid, it was tricked so easily. Tricked with simple technological tactics. 

America invented the #semiconductor and the #internet for God's sake! How did we become so dumb, that we let an adversary use our own tech against us.

It's embarrassing, almost every American should be embarrassed about the values they hold. Education is paramount. If our nation is to be strong, we must educate our children and strive to help them learn from our mistakes, so they can be better than us. This is true progress.  The majority of MAGA people seem jealous of the younger generation, and don't want us to be better than them.  They seem to be in competition with us, rather than trying to build us up. We will need to replace them some day, and they aren't letting us grow by telling us things used to be better.

My generation will be able to tell their children, with honesy, that things used to be better. We will explain to them that the #selfish #babyboomers ruined progress in the world. Mainly the backwards thinking ones, but the majority of them played, and continue to play, a very selfish role in society.",2020-10-23T13:30:59Z

Trump: ""but the cages are so clean""
Trump is constantly bitching about how it was Obama that ripped kids from their parents, but that as usual is taken out of context!
when there were concerns about kids being used by coyotes, or when they came alone over the border, yes, the government under Obama had to take care of the kids, and if the kids were in danger they were removed from the people that might be hurting them.
Trump made it so that they took all kids from THEIR PARENTS!!! Took them away from their documented parents simply to be cruel! 
That is not the same as what happened before! 
That is not comparable AT ALL and anyone that believes this is just blind!
trump is simply wrong when claiming the Obama-administration split kids from their parents without any underlying reason to protect the kids. trump is just disgusting and showing how completely void of morality or empathy for others he is.....",2020-10-23T12:36:33Z

That is just wrong!
Dr. Fauci said in the beginning of this virus that ""AT THIS TIME"" there is no need to wear masks, he said ""AT THIS TIME, But this might change quickly"", to claim anything else is just complete lies, just like Trump does on everything, just complete lies!
Fauci never said that it will go away soon, that is what Trump has been saying from February! Fauchi never said this will go away, he talked about how things were at the time, that they did not know enough at this time, that they have to follow how this evolves and change how they act according to how the situation changes.

But Trump still managed to go on and on with his lies and utter rubbish, talking and trying to hog the time for as long possible after the two minute section was up. I really wish they weren‚Äôt allowed to mud sling, stick to policy and facts. Personal attacks are so low bar.

Why didn't he remove and replace the ACA when the Republican Party held both the House and Senate his first 2 years in office?

Why do we have to pay farmers billions upon billions of American taxpayer dollars if we are winning the Trade War in China? How will the farm industry recoup the permanent business they lost? What's the plan?

Why did we have to raid the DOD for millions of dollars to replace fencing along the border when Mexico was supposed to pay for a real wall?

Why hasn't Trump released his tax returns when every 2 weeks for the last 4 years, he has said ""soon""?

How can the Coronavirus be the ""Chinese Plague"", but at the same time be ""nothing to worry about""? Where is any unified national plan regarding the handling of Covid19? Trump did the only thing the states couldn't do, which was close the border. After that the ""beautiful"" tests failed, he made declarations based on hunches, ignored all science, threw experts under the bus for the administration's lack of preparedness, criticized Governor's for trying to protect its citizens, never led by example regarding social distancing and mask wearing, and even after being hospitalized and receiving experimental treatment, still does  not recognize or implement the safety mesaures we all need to follow as a nation in order to open up our economy again. 

You want your life back, wear a mask, avoid gatherings, wash your hands, make 2020 the year of saving and spending time with family. The economy is not measured by the stock market, but by unemployment and GDP. The market is inflated and held a float by the corporate tax break, which in short term will yield great results, but eventually the false structure it is built on will collapse. 401ks are long term investments, today's stock prices can be considered negligible when looking at the bigger picture. 

2020 happened under Trump, how did he respond? 

Every former President alive today has expressed their support for Joe Biden. 
Countless senators and congressman have spoken on behalf of Joe Biden.

No GOP senator or congressman has acted as a surrogate for Trump as only his wife, daughter, son and son-in-law have been the voices for the Trump campaign.

Russia, Iran, North Korea, China all want Donald J Trump as the President of the United States. The rest of the world, including ALL of our once allies, want anybody else.

There is no statue of limitations in the justice system. Money made by city courts and the criminal justice system run many city government's budgets. It's not all about race, but government forcing us to fill out an ethnic form every time we go to a doctor, a  school, dshs food stamps, or a job application it makes it seem more important to know what you are verses who you are as a human being. Quit making quotas, and mandates. Quit making officers lives unimportant by not giving them the hardware and training and mental evaluations on continual basis that they need. It's easy to point the fingers at one side, but by taking respect out of the schools and replacing it with sex ed, taking God and father's out of the home and saying women are better single parents, have all contributed to this unaccountable society we have.

The only thing I could say right now in true confidence is that God gave us this life. We have God blood pumping through all of us. Among the many blessings God gave us as  humans is choice. Plus a strong human body that is capable of fabricating whatever future we wish and so desire out of this world. If we only dedicate ourselves  to do so.

Don't count on your government to help you or save you. Your life is your own and it's really all up to you and what you make of it.

Deadweight losses occur when the minimum wage is above the equilibrium point (some people are perfectly willing to be paid $13 an hour and some companies are willing to pay that rate, but because of the minimum wage of $15/hour, they can't do it anymore). This would cause job terminations (the higher the minimum wage, the higher the number of job terminations) and an increased unemployment rate. As different regions have different workforce supply and demand curves, the solution is to define the minimum wage rates with a quantitative formula for those regions, with an absolute lowest bound nationally.

America needs managers and not pocket-filling men of poly-tics= multiple bloodsucking insects. I am not a Yankee Doodle, but I know who would make Amerika great again. Both talked about health care, in other words doctors and medicines, most of which  cause more damage to people than good. There was no talk about how to make America healthier again. It should be the No.1 subject in schools, on the media. More people contract cancer from processed foods and GMOs than even from pollution. Education is rubbish in many parts of the world, it makes people into zombees. People only dream  of fancier poisonous food, entertainment (they need not think)  bigger cars and boats houses and swimming pools, instead of thinking, enjoying nature, the blessings of God,  the fantastic knowledge around us, simplicity of life, good health.

Too much theatre, too much attack, not enough thoughtful answers by our President.  President Trump did much better this time, at least I was able to hear Mr. Biden without constant interruptions from the President. Former Vice President Biden did well too, though he appeared to tire about an hour in. My position on the issues align much more closely with Mr. Biden's, though I am far, far to the left of him. Much more left politically. (Left to me means: I want for all people, world peace, good paying jobs, stellar health care and education. I demand humane treatment for our factory food animals. I demand a serious effort by my species to reduce our corruption in our institutions worldwide. And I demand a major focus on reducing climate warming fuel emissions because, I fear, the warming taking place has us on the path to extinction.) Mr. Biden is not left enough in his proposed policies for me. Still, I believe he and his team will successfully manage the coronavirus crisis in this country. I have no faith that our President will successfully manage the virus, although, I must admit, he and his Administration have done an excellent job encouraging the necessary businesses to quickly develop needed vaccines. I give him that, to his credit though, frankly any leader with the resources and an upcoming election would push to speed the delivery of vaccines to combat a pandemic. I rate this debate a C- because I loathe this style of debate, which is too theatric for my tastes. I wish our presidential debates were a higher quality product, where leaders actually discuss serious planned executions of ideas and strategies to solve the many problems we have. Mr. Biden did that and he kept trying. Our President is more about verbal attacks. He can excel in them, at times. Too bad he does not excel in providing quality leadership. I expect perfection from no one. We are not a perfect people. But I demand quality from my leaders. Our President has not demonstrated an ability to give me quality leadership. He separated infants and children from their migrating parents to discourage lawful migrants and asylum seekers ftom entering this country. This despite laws on the books where America says it will accept asylum seekers who meet certain criteria. He and his team did evil. You don't remove nursing infants and toddlers and young children from their parents, just because they dare to attempt to migrate to your country. That is evil. Hundreds of children are still without their families. That, and many things he's done, are unacceptable to me. I can't accept his racism. I can't accept his public denial of climate warming which I believe will kill our species if we refuse to handle the problem. I can't accept his seemingly constant lying, for no reason. I can't accept the possible corruption. I don't hate him.  I loathe most of his policies, those that I'm aware of. He'll likely get a bounce in the polls from this debate. I understand his base values him. I respect their right to endorse their candidate. He is not my choice. Too shady, too incompetent.",2020-10-23T03:42:32Z

Trump has been under constant scrutiny for every reason under the sun. Had he been censored from the getgo and had Back to the Future 2 had a different villain, very few would find something to complain about. He doesn't speak a politician's language (aka bullshit lies disguised as confections with pretty packaging) he will speak lamens terms, although I will admit, sometimes it sounds like series of farts in a baron cornfield after harvest. Before Trump, people were against most things political, control of the people etc... Biden isn't your solution. Your tax dollars have been going down the crapper since time immemorial, and never before have news stations been so biased, enough to lie to everyone in order to shift the votes in the direction these elitist asswipes want it to go, and these puppeteers will pull any strings they have to to convince you that Trump has been a terrible president thus far, when that is simply not the case.

( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OELmaJqTOuq4it-dmakqhsgzcT9qqIgR/view?usp=sharing ) to many idolatry temples in the world via the regular mail and online , and I will keep sending it and urging the real believers in Allah to send it until Allah concludes a predetermined matter, but before you read it I would like to talk to you‚Ä¶ the politicians ( policymakers ) in Western society and in the same time to all people in Western society through this message , My words with you will be a four questions I will ask you and I will answer them on your behalf. 
My first question is: Are you against violence and hatred speech and the factors and motives that incite violence and hatred?? Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!! 
My second question is: Are you a supporters and encouragers of so-called personal freedoms, freedom of demonstrations, and freedom of expression of opinions, freedom of religions, equality between men and women and same sex marriage?? Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!! 
My third question is: Is the death penalty abolished from your judicial systems because you consider it as a savage barbaric act and not suited to the contemporary man?? Your answer is: of course it is!... absolutely yes!!
My fourth and final question is: What do you do to the murderers? Where do you place them?? Do you put them in a resorts you call it jails!! in order to eat the best food and to exercise sports and to practice fitness on the latest sports equipments, and to watch TV and to use the Internet and to read books, magazines and newspapers in their clean place which equipped with a central heating and cooling all the times, and always you provide them a health care at all levels, And from time to time you supply them a new outerwear and underwear and pyjamas and perfumes and new shoes, and you protect them around the clock ,and no anybody has the right to touch them badly at all or to threaten them or to abuse them physically or verbally ,and nobody has the right even to annoying them or to disturb them at any time ,and on top of all of that they are not demanded to pay a cent for the costs of that wonderful life, but in fact the families of their victims are demanded to pay the costs for all of that from their own looted money which you call it TAX?? Your answer is: of course we do!... absolutely yes!!  
Well.... according to your answers, it is very clear and it is very obvious that Without a feeling, and without noticing, and unintentionally you are the ones who definitely creating the environment for the existence of violence, hatred and crimes, and you are the ones who inciting and encouraging all of that to be existed continuously and to be spread and to be exacerbated. 
Now listen carefully what I am going to say ‚Ä¶..
Allah is the Lord of the worlds, and he is the Creator of the worlds, and all the human beings are one of His creations, Allah has graciously revealed His mercy to mankind , His mercy is the Religion of Islam ... and the Quran is the Words of Allah which are addressed to all human beings, Quran is a sacred and a Holy words, It is the Constitution from the Creator to the people , The whole Quran is a completed and integrated unit...it is cannot be followed and obeyed some of Quran verses and ignore the rest , in order to please people and to satisfy them!.
The non serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God's constitution in the whole earth means a disbelief in God and a hypocrisy in its clearest form ... and it means the recognition and the acceptance of the existence of crimes in all forms in everywhere...and that will be the reason for the destruction of all human societies in all their differences.
The serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God's constitution in the whole earth means a real protection and a real preservation to all people in everywhere. 
Do you find up to this point that these words inciting violence, hatred and terrorism!?... Or you think the denying of God's existence and to his constitution and to eradicate Islam religion would be the best option and the superior choice ?!.. In order to embrace your laws and to please you and to satisfy you and to avoid your anger and to be that a clear obedience to your laws which inciting the ignorance, crimes and corruption in the whole earth.. Which been created by God.. And which only God own it !! 
Blessed be Allah who says : (( Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that they desire? Who is better than Allah in judgment for people who are certain?)) , Allah is the Lord of the worlds and He is the Dominator to his creatures He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the unbelievers )) , and He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the evildoers )) , and He said: ((Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the sinners)). God does not call for violence and hatred, in fact he encourages and motivates and forces people to live in the earth as He wills...Not to live every person as he likes and wishes ,  Allah is the only Creator...he is our Creator. 
No one can understand the God's Justice and His divine logic except those who have the ability to understand and to think and to conceive through the pure logic. 
God has wrathed and cursed and prepared a terrible punishment to anyone who believes in some of His words and deliberately ignores the rest of them, He said : (( Do you believe in part of the Book and defy another part? So what is the requital of those of you who do that except disgrace in the life of this world? And on the Day of Resurrection, they shall be consigned to the severest punishment. And Allah is not oblivious of what you do))‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

They do not start their Trump Lansing, Michigan, until AFTER Trump plays videos clips showing Biden verbatim LIES about China, fracking, social security, and NAFTA.
It is hard to believe C-Span turns their 'UNFILTERED NEWS' logo, into a palpable LIE.

Hilarious. Then offers no explanation, but an ad misericordiam argument. Sorry folks, this is all BIG SMOKE because the Dems--hate to enlighten you--think you're stupid and they know what's best. Biden knows damn-well that we all have the right to our own moral sentiments. You can't standardize non-prejudice. That's part of a local-cultural background. To offer explicit awareness training is purely policing ideology on the pretty side of the table (this time around). WAKE UP! They are causing the division! They don't benefit from racism or poverty falling. They'd have no votes. They bank on you being interested in short-term gains, and after 30 years when they don't deliver--oh, well, we'll put Pelosi or Hilary in a leather jacket and teach her another line of Spanish. See, the Dems play on these issues. Trump talks agenda and infrastructure. The left only gives you HATE SPEECH--like, ""he's a bad boy"" and other reactionary agendas. Idiots should have gone back to the drawing board, figured out what you actually stood for, and redefined the party and found new representation to deliver it. Instead, they wasted 4 years trying to lynch the winner! THIS IS a democracy! Don't vote if you can't accept the possibility of loss. We don't live in a monarchical society. It's one term. Chill the fu*^ OUT! And stop the loaded question about condemning white supremacy. That plays into their hand. Then they turn around and say, SEE, HE LEADS THEM. NO! He has no more reason to do so than Biden. I'd be insulted! I would neer address those low-rent assh(&&Y as the President. Shame on these liberals for commandeering real issues of social inequality for their own self-serving political gains. Seriously, when someone talks to you like you need a handout... ask what thefu*& these people are up to. You think Obama established healthcare penalties because he loves us or something...wake up! They'll be singing John Lennon songs while we approach 0% exports with 230% tax on the speculative possibility of exports--and the new silk road pulls out with every import we depend on... short term gains.

If long-cherished ideals and time-honored institutions, if certain social assumptions and religious formulae have ceased to promote the welfare of the generality of mankind, if they no longer minister to the needs of a continually evolving humanity, let them be swept away and relegated to the limbo of obsolescent and forgotten doctrines. Why should these, in a world subject to the immutable law of change and decay, be exempt from the deterioration that must needs overtake every human institution?

When they STRIKE (2nd Horseman Sword= STRIKE it), that Rock, it will SPLIT (3rd Horseman= Scales = SPLIT it) and a SPLIT piece of it will hit Our Planet, that is the 4th Horseman of Armageddon, the FIRE = SEAR it. Wake up WORLD!! Armageddon is upon Us. WATCH to the WEST for it will hit the Pacific Ocean and it will rock up and down the Pacific FIRE RING and it will send lava to the Skies when it does. It will rain fire over 2/3rd's of this planet! If you live anywhere near the Pacific, you need to move now! Move BEFORE they STOP sending the Rockets up, that's when you'll know they are ready and waiting on the rock to get here. Please come see my Armageddon video and make sure you read all my comments!

I sent the attached file: ( The earth belongs to Allah ) This Is The Link : 
( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OELmaJqTOuq4it-dmakqhsgzcT9qqIgR/view?usp=sharing ) to many idolatry temples in the world via the regular mail and online , and I will keep sending it and urging the real believers in Allah to send it until Allah concludes a predetermined matter, but before you read it I would like to talk to you‚Ä¶ the politicians ( policymakers ) in Western society and in the same time to all people in Western society through this message , My words with you will be a four questions I will ask you and I will answer them on your behalf. 
My first question is: Are you against violence and hatred speech and the factors and motives that incite violence and hatred?? Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!! 
My second question is: Are you a supporters and encouragers of so-called personal freedoms, freedom of demonstrations, and freedom of expression of opinions, freedom of religions, equality between men and women and same sex marriage?? Your answer is: of course we are!... absolutely yes!! 
My third question is: Is the death penalty abolished from your judicial systems because you consider it as a savage barbaric act and not suited to the contemporary man?? Your answer is: of course it is!... absolutely yes!!
My fourth and final question is: What do you do to the murderers? Where do you place them?? Do you put them in a resorts you call it jails!! in order to eat the best food and to exercise sports and to practice fitness on the latest sports equipments, and to watch TV and to use the Internet and to read books, magazines and newspapers in their clean place which equipped with a central heating and cooling all the times, and always you provide them a health care at all levels, And from time to time you supply them a new outerwear and underwear and pyjamas and perfumes and new shoes, and you protect them around the clock ,and no anybody has the right to touch them badly at all or to threaten them or to abuse them physically or verbally ,and nobody has the right even to annoying them or to disturb them at any time ,and on top of all of that they are not demanded to pay a cent for the costs of that wonderful life, but in fact the families of their victims are demanded to pay the costs for all of that from their own looted money which you call it TAX?? Your answer is: of course we do!... absolutely yes!!  
Well.... according to your answers, it is very clear and it is very obvious that Without a feeling, and without noticing, and unintentionally you are the ones who definitely creating the environment for the existence of violence, hatred and crimes, and you are the ones who inciting and encouraging all of that to be existed continuously and to be spread and to be exacerbated. 
Now listen carefully what I am going to say ‚Ä¶..
Allah is the Lord of the worlds, and he is the Creator of the worlds, and all the human beings are one of His creations, Allah has graciously revealed His mercy to mankind , His mercy is the Religion of Islam ... and the Quran is the Words of Allah which are addressed to all human beings, Quran is a sacred and a Holy words, It is the Constitution from the Creator to the people , The whole Quran is a completed and integrated unit...it is cannot be followed and obeyed some of Quran verses and ignore the rest , in order to please people and to satisfy them!.
The non serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God's constitution in the whole earth means a disbelief in God and a hypocrisy in its clearest form ... and it means the recognition and the acceptance of the existence of crimes in all forms in everywhere...and that will be the reason for the destruction of all human societies in all their differences.
The serious striving by a visible ways to implement all God's constitution in the whole earth means a real protection and a real preservation to all people in everywhere. 
Do you find up to this point that these words inciting violence, hatred and terrorism!?... Or you think the denying of God's existence and to his constitution and to eradicate Islam religion would be the best option and the superior choice ?!.. In order to embrace your laws and to please you and to satisfy you and to avoid your anger and to be that a clear obedience to your laws which inciting the ignorance, crimes and corruption in the whole earth.. Which been created by God.. And which only God own it !! 
Blessed be Allah who says : (( Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that they desire? Who is better than Allah in judgment for people who are certain?)) , Allah is the Lord of the worlds and He is the Dominator to his creatures He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the unbelievers )) , and He said : (( Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the evildoers )) , and He said: ((Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the sinners)). God does not call for violence and hatred, in fact he encourages and motivates and forces people to live in the earth as He wills...Not to live every person as he likes and wishes ,  Allah is the only Creator...he is our Creator. 
No one can understand the God's Justice and His divine logic except those who have the ability to understand and to think and to conceive through the pure logic. 
God has wrathed and cursed and prepared a terrible punishment to anyone who believes in some of His words and deliberately ignores the rest of them, He said : (( Do you believe in part of the Book and defy another part? So what is the requital of those of you who do that except disgrace in the life of this world? And on the Day of Resurrection, they shall be consigned to the severest punishment. And Allah is not oblivious of what you do ))‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

41. Corruption has appeared on land and sea, because of what people‚Äôs hands have earned, in order to make them taste some of what they have done, so that they might return.

42. Say, ‚ÄúRoam the earth, and observe the fate of those who came before. Most of them were idolaters.‚Äù

43. So devote yourself to the upright religion, before there comes from God a Day that cannot be averted. On that Day, they will be shocked.

44. Whoever disbelieves, upon him falls his disbelief. And whoever acts righteously‚Äîthey are preparing for themselves.

45. So that He may reward those who have believed and done the righteous deeds out of His bounty. Indeed, He does not love the ungrateful.

46. And of His signs is that He sends the winds bearing good news, to give you a taste of His mercy, and so that the ships may sail by His command, and so that you may seek of His bounty, and so that you may give thanks.

1.) Covid vaccine in weeks. When asked to guaranty he blackout üòä
2.) Paying tax in tens of millions but do not file tax since four years. He said same thing during first election.
3.) Evaded question on separating 500 childrens to asking who built jails instead of answering why they separated. Building jails is not bad but making inhuman decisions is crime as Biden said.
4.) He knew in January how severe this decease is but said it will vanish soon because it will effect his business. 
5.) He is racist and has done nothing to black community. We'll know what he thinks about all communities except white people and mind you only RICH WHITE. 
6.) HE insulted other countries calling Russia, China, India as filthy but when he was in India he said India is great, nice and love India.... He is two faced. 
7.) Trump is tuff only to countries like Iran, Syria, Palestine which are poor, helpless, and military is not strong. North Korea violated all their promises but he did not put sanctions. 
8.) When asked about NKorea he said Kim is friendly with him but what about his breaches? Iran does nothing but he orders to kill their Generals. 

Trump on 1st presidential election podium said he evades tax... That's enough for Americans tax department to put him behind bars let alone context for presidency. If he gets elected Americans are most niave people.",2020-10-23T22:55:33Z

But watching this debate, I can see how Biden often deflects from actually answering the question and tries to pull us Americans in emotionally in a manipulative way, which is not something I want in a president. He tries to demonize President Trump for shutting down the economy because of COVID-19 when he would have no idea how to handle it himself. In fact, he would make the economy worse if he were elected because he wants to keep ObamaCare which is super expensive and is promising ‚Äúfree‚Äù things that aren‚Äôt really free and are paid by giving everyone ridiculously high taxes (except for him and the rich people). Also, he wants to talk about women‚Äôs rights yet is okay with a child being murdered because it should be a woman‚Äôs ‚Äúchoice.‚Äù Why doesn‚Äôt the baby get a choice? It‚Äôs the baby‚Äôs life being taken from them. I understand that sometimes there are terrible circumstances and a woman is scared to have the child, but it‚Äôs still MURDER. If you killed someone you saw on the street, you would go to jail for life for it, but if you kill a growing baby, heartless people celebrate your ‚Äúright‚Äù to choose instead of admitting that it‚Äôs murder no matter what pregnancy term the mother was in or the circumstances of the pregnancy. I won‚Äôt vote for a liar, manipulator, and advocate for murder. President Trump supports pro-life, lower taxes than what Biden would cause, a healthcare that would be better than Obamacare, the military, and family values. Don‚Äôt buy into the lies of men like Biden just because he gets good press. Instead of relying on what the media tells you, think for yourself and do your research. President Trump is gonna win this election and continue to make America great again. And even if you hate me or disagree with me for all that I just said, I respect your political views even if they‚Äôre different than mine. Because we‚Äôre all human beings at the end of the day just trying to make our country better. God Bless Youüôèüèª",2020-10-23T08:19:21Z

Every one of us has broken God‚Äôs moral law, the Ten Commandments. We‚Äôve all lied and we‚Äôve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that breaking even just one of these commandments makes us guilty of breaking them all. 

The problem is, we can never ‚Äòoutweigh‚Äô our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .

Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‚Äòit is finished‚Äô.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace;

Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response; 

Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved .

The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife. 

You‚Äôve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.

Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don‚Äôt even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn‚Äôt guaranteed.. and as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27);
‚ÄòIt is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT‚Äô.

All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ .

2020-10-23T02:43:41Z,@whatwho9595,wW1lY5jFNcQ,"My thoughts on the debate. Trump made a nice comment putting fault on neither of the pandemic, however if Trump wants to play golf one day after week he should be able to, I like the low shade regarding Joe biden's son issues that was vicious, 99% but I understand I was in the slow class in math too(4real it was about 10 and I still graduated from college), Trump opening schools regardless if the school has active Covid..yikes, Liked Walk and Chew Gum, Loved Trump's Facial expressions hopefully it will be used on Tik Tok some how,  true what Trump stated about New York but the country is living in a time where people Do not have the money to waste on Gucci belts, Comparing Dr. Fauci to making a mistake verse the President making a mistake for his country, Loved Trump saying he got People in Wall Street to show his Clout, liked the woman of color hosting, her lashes and talking to Trump like a Junior High Teacher for him to focus,, loved the explanation of Sovereignty, loved the Orange glow but his hands don't match his face, Bob Barker 1st Cousin, Top Crip Representative and Top Blood Rep with an OG gangsta lean, love to watch rich people argue about poor people, I said ""You Do"" and was mad he didn't say it again, How THE HELL DO U PREPAY TAXES cus I'll prepay $20 and keep it moving.. damn White Privilege..lmao..,  too shady Trump Talking trash about his Brothers, loved the Flip Flop Trump talking trash on China but said he thought about working with them..lol.., Loved hearing White People say Malarchy, Trump saying Typical Politician but he is a politician, his love for the people of Seoul, Biden said Trump got thugs for friends lol, Confused on ""I could have gone the other route and everyone would have been unhappy"", felt like Trump was staring directly at me (wtf was the other route. NEW World Order?), Melania looking like a nija because she is mersible, Loved Biden's smooth pimp daddy laugh, Trump low flirt with the host, damn he ain't even from Scranton, Alabama is Different from NY??? Maybe fashion but we all need to survive..damn, OMG People coming over on Coyotes instead big saying Donkeys, Who built the cages? Damn. Cages!!, The enlarged eyes Of Trump when Biden talked about freeing those immigrant children, A rapist is a very bad person too as Trump could not think of another Option, Perry Mason shout out, Lowest IQ can come back to the country, 500 kids not knowing where their parents are and said  Good?!?!?! As a DCPP investigator And have worked with DV victims from their Husbands who beat them and tell them they can't call the police because they are illegal and the children have to witness this every day and night..not cool, Trump said he Helped Two Black people with loans....lol..""I'm the least racist""?!?!?lmao.. means you have racism thoughts and possibly ways..and to honest WE ARE ALL RACIST ON THE LOW..but when you have to leave your feelings at home and put on a fake ass smile in the world...Why not say He is not racist, because it wouldn't be realistic for anyone.  Wow someone calls u a racist and your mad about Abraham Lincoln comment.. lmao,  Loved Trump saying ""These Politicians, ALL TALK NO ACTION WAS THE BEST, Trump confusing Vice President Biden position from President Obama running the country, AND I MISSED THE EAGLES GAME.

And that way other industries such as the media would be more easily regulated rather than serve as personal platforms for utter destructiveness to individuals.  But there's a hitch:  that is not a permanent likelihood ever for a shifting back and forth politics;  now that the far left communists have been shut out and effectively erased by the media, as anything on behalf of those who would have unified the world for that common goal of respects, including the moral ones to empower moderately well-off individuals (straight white and middle income along with the whole slew of other factors) of ways to advance/provide/develop environments of global inter-connected interests.  The way in which torture developed as a common bargaining right and offer/option in all forms of everyone's lifestyle and it definitely did and skyrocketed as such, for people who believe in animals and their lives/rights, wasn't necessary - that's what frames anyone so brutalist to still be unwittingly servicing the whole enterprise of greatly evil personal projection.  None of it was at all good or necessary except in the common democracy purely and absolutely for men only, and that is fundamentally so, with a period.  It completely has zero grace of women.  Only the servicing of the same old right-wing swathe of mentalities creating a foundation of abuse and demands for hidden horror contains their same rising desire into sins unable to be matched by what's lost in that decision to wipe out the democratic class chance as more sophisticated than the opposite to the first mentioned point;  the greed to acquire, acquire, acquire, and make sense, of the simple right of the rule of cash as law.  It isn't moral, and wickedly over-moralized the concept of freedom as the least possible not just probable of a higher capacity so to have that human part of the lasting character over and with as part of the world.  That points out that we are as part of our environment possibly affecting our inclinations democratic as such and not just nature, which goes farther and that does guide some individuals even up to the level of science in some completeness, which exaggerates oftentimes its claim, as a philosophy, of the mechanics of reason to it purely;  but that can be confused, and there is some simple humanity and freedom within its limits, and not just in ways a new, holistic but demanding culture is raising perhaps the majority of liberals in a state more unfamiliar as humane to some escapees such as hippies and their sense of freedom, and the role of the limited focus otherwise of love as eternal.

i don't understand how americans voted for trump ( he keeps lying to them, insult everyone deflects blame 
towards others, ) But that not the worst part . (To me at least) he shook hands with dictators ( poutine , north Korea) treathning to destroy the alliance between america and Europe. Left the Paris accord ( because let's face it he didn't believe  climate change) 
And Now he is threating the american democracy by saying to extremist stand by.  I  know next to nothing about Joe biden but i know this : he is a democrat , he was the vice-president of america , and was never accused for being incompetent. He also doesn't insult or lie ( not to my knowledge at least). 
So yeah Biden is pretty much an improvement compared to trump.

America as global superpower may well be over because of trump and we all know that the ambitious Xi would jump at the opportunity to become the first superpower in the world ( which is scary considering that China is not a democracy . Not offense to the people of China)",2020-10-22T06:43:34Z

Donald Trump is in no way at all president material as for Joe Biden I don't believe that he is either president material but Joe Biden is better then Donald Trump in many ways. Donald Trump got Covid19 most likely because he did not wear a mask. I agree with Joe Biden on wearing masks and Covid19. I know many people that have died due to Covid19. Who Knows even if there will be a vaccine for Covid19. Joe Biden made many points but I disagree with some of them. Donald Trump is saying we don't need masks. They might not work but its not like we know at this point we need to were them even if they don't work we don't even know.

2020-10-21T23:42:49Z,@maikenlindstad,wW1lY5jFNcQ,"Actually, and this is the only thing I can say anything about from the debate, In Norway many believe that masks will enhance the risk of getting COVID due to us touching our face more often than usual because we have to fix or correct the mask. Also, some sources in Norway say that the COVID bacteria is not stopped by any fabric material, but by a special mask that's hard to get for any regular customer. I think I saw Kim Kardashian wear one. I, myself, use a regular mask to warn people from moving closer to me because there are FOR REAL no one that keeps their distance (I move like a ball in a pin-ball machine to avoid people that's passing me), but I believe that using a mask can make people remember they should stay away. And of course avoid any spit or snot of mine finding it's way towards others. However... When I use a mask, I get all these strange looks, and I've only seen ONE other person use a mask in public! ONE! It's actually frowned upon some places. It's so freaking weird to recieve these looks. I do believe in using a mask as long as one does not touch the mask or face! And of course remove the mask properly and dispose, or wash, when done with it. 

I am not an American, I just want to enlighten others to what goes on in other countries. Maybe someone could enlighten the Norwegians? As long as the mask is properly handled I think it's very smart to use it, but not if the mask is not handled properly. Where is the ""How to use a mask"" information commercial?",2020-10-21T23:52:15Z

2020-10-21T15:18:27Z,@jenniferreinoehl7883,wW1lY5jFNcQ,"I hated this circus the first time I watched it but watching it again, I find it interesting that President Trump was noted for his interruptions. He clearly did not join in the fray until after Joe and the Moderator had already interrupted him many times and cut what he was saying short. 30:30-President Trump given 2 minutes to talk about Supreme Court Appointment. 31:50 President Trump finishes ten seconds early. 31:56 Joe Biden starts his rebuttal. 34:03 Joe Biden finishes (slightly past time). Trump starts talking immediately in rebuttal to that (which is standard for debates I have seen in person and on television). 34:29 Joe Biden interrupts Trump. 34:39 Joe Biden interrupts Trump. 34:52 Joe Biden interrupts Trump. 34:56 Moderator interrupts Trump (and another one of Biden's interruptions) to tell them they are in ""open discussion"" (a new concept for this debate based on all the past presidential debates I have watched). The Moderator gives Biden permission to keep speaking (despite the fact Trump was in the middle of responding to one of Biden's asides and Trump has spent less than a minute responding and was interrupted three times). 35:00 Joe Biden begins talking. 35:28 Trump interrupts Biden. 35:44 Trump interrupts Biden. 36:07 Trump interrupts Biden and takes floor after Joe asks question-Joe has had a full minute to speak with three Trump interruptions. 36.14 Joe interrupts and continues interrupting until 36:25. The Moderator interrupts Trump at 36:28. Biden and the Moderator both continue interrupting with Biden finally telling Trump to ""shut-up"" at 36:34. At 36:39, the Moderator stops Trump from talking and again turns it over to Biden despite the fact Trump was responding to something Biden interrupted with. 36:53 Trump interrupts with a question to Biden. 37:07 Biden admits he doesn't know the nominated Justice's view on Roe v Wade despite making claims she is anti-Row v Wade. 37:08 The Moderator interrupts Biden and Trump and concludes the topic. 

37:57 Moderator says Trump has never come up with a replacement plan (which even I know he has-here is a blog post from someone talking about it right after the 2016 election: https://www.naylornetwork.com/cmsatoday/articles/index-v3.asp?aid=411290&issueID=53655) 38:22 The Moderator prevents Trump from stating he has a plan--and re-asks the question stating Trump has not come up with a plan! Dude, if you are going to Moderate and ask questions, (1) You cannot always give the floor to Biden; (2) You should ask questions that are politically NEUTRAL and that can be asked to BOTH candidates WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT REWORDING (i.e. a good Moderator would have said ""What is your plan for Healthcare over the next 4 years?"") (3) A good Moderator should at least do some research. 

At this point, I feel confirmed in my original opinion that this was not a real debate but a staged Democratic party political ploy, and although I have voted for Democrats in years past and am not sure I will vote for Trump this year (something I wouldn't have even considered in the Spring), I am definitely sure that I am not going to vote for a single Democrat because they are stifling free speech and not letting the public see both sides. The first amendment says that everyone is allowed to share their opinions, but the Democrats want to put a mute button on Trump. Why? If Democrats have the best party and the best platform, they would let people hear what Trump has to say so the people can decide. You want a fair debate, you shut off the opposing person and the Moderator's mics for two minutes while each person is talking, and you don't have an open free-for-all where Democrat candidates can interrupt without censure but Republican candidates cannot. You choose questions you can ask both parties about their policies not politically heated, one-sided hot-points. Done watching this one and won't watch anymore, nor will I blame President Trump if he refuses to debate.",2020-10-21T15:59:53Z

Despite this, in theory, a man in this position shouldn't have weak points, in reality, no one has a perfect view of anything. I will happily accept that both Trump and Bidden are right and wrong in various matters, but I (and probably everyone) simply can't accept that a presidential debate should go like this. They are speaking badly with each other but most importantly, they attack the person. ""liar"", ""clown"", ""just shut up man"", ""you can't talk to me with the word ""smart"" because you graduated in x college in x position"".. Excuse me? Are we grown-ups or what?

2020-10-21T01:50:56Z,@soulpinkendeavors,wW1lY5jFNcQ,"Watching this you can literally see distinct personality differences between Trump and Biden. I can tell Biden is more calm and collected and shrugs off Trump nicely by laughing off his insults and putting him in his place. I can see a glimpse of compassion in him as well. Trump is more arrogant, loud, judgmental, incessantly interrupts and talks over people, and thinks he knows everything about bringing peace to America. He literally doesn't think he has any flaws in his character. 

Trump assumes there is nothing smart about Biden. Biden probably knows more than he says. Who is Trump to tell who is smart and who's not. In 47 years, Biden probably gained a lot of experience in politics whereas trump hasn't done much to help build America up during the 4 years of his presidency. I personally agree more with Biden and his plans.",2020-10-21T02:08:29Z

Firstly, look at the difference, honestly, just from what you hear over here:

Trump is talking facts and success, and things he accomplished.

Biden talks mostly flowery words that seem to be an attempt to appeal to people by saying what he thinks they want to hear. Without much if any substance or things to prove past success (and he was in politics for much longer..) doing what he claims.

B

Biden is blaming violence and weaker economy on trump.

Well, look at the facts.

It was a democrat party which supported blm, which included much much violence and chaos, the news actually showing much of this.

Consistently on videos, democrats are seen attacking, even physically anyone who simply shows they are a trump supporter. 
A democracy, I would think would actually support two parties and consideration of both sides, respectfully, and, obviously without violence.

Economy?
It is due to a shutdown which he and the party he's supposed to represent were and are urging it to be done. 
But trump is the president, the one who advocates lessoning of a complete shutdown, so they are wrongfully blaming him for their own advocated policies.

Again, he keeps on making promises, and talking as though he's speaking for the American people, saying simply saying whatever he thinks they would want to hear.

Now people are worried about the President refusing to step down right?

Well, since the President was elected, it is his side which were and continue to not accept him as President. There is more to be said.

Is comforting. You could actually feel the empathy and his concern to the nation almost everytime he speaks. He was just overwhelmed by a constant interuption of Mr. Trump. Yes, he's not perfect but I rather choose him than a leader who is ego-centric and always tend to sugar coat the mistakes rather than thinking how to fix it and implement solutions for a better change.

The moderator is not bias, they have to interject to keep information accurate, and airtime fair both of which are in public interest. If trump violates those principles more, I am sure to his fans the moderator seems ""biased"". But your issue is with the moderator attempting to keep the debate on course when your issue should be with trump trying to derail it. He gets nervous and impulsive every time Biden is making a valid criticism or academically informed point. So he squirms and interrupts. Trump couldn't win a debate in which he was allowed to interrupt and a Fox (i.e. republican) moderated. Good luck debating next week with the new debate rules including muted microphones donald.

And I feel like joe is trying to speak for the people because he knows people are fed up he actually wants to make a change. Trump is just beating  around the bush. Joe was right trump has done nothing  these past 4 years but talk shit. If he actually wanted to make a change he would‚Äôve if he wanted to make things better he would‚Äôve. Trump is saying random things that have nothing to do with this debate, nothing about corona, nothing about the Supreme Court and nothing about the economy.

I don't want to see rich people get taxed harder because then they gone hire machines to do the job, and this will prevent new businesses from growing, I dont wanna see mandates on healthcare it allows for implantable micro chips, and I don't care about Russia nor China's or Foreign economy.",2020-10-18T11:58:29Z
2020-10-18T11:34:48Z,@mixz9929,wW1lY5jFNcQ,Its sad but seems like Trump is just having fun toying with Biden.    However because its kinda obvious Bidens head is not in the game its like he doesn't know what's going on . no  game plan and he can't answer the debaters question at all .   Trump is simply on a much higher level .   I dnt think Biden is a bad person but i believe Democrats would want Biden elected just because he would be a yes man and allow who ever to make the decisions.,2020-10-18T11:34:48Z

A different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater the rich
And an abandon the poor
Like they understand you
In the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
These fuckers are laughing their way
To the bank and cashing their check
Asking you to have compassion and to have some respect

For a leader so nervous
In an obvious way
Stuttering and mumbling
For nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world
Watching at the end of the day
In the living room laughing
Like what did he say?

Dictionary definition of Presidential: ‚Äúhaving a bearing or demeanor befitting a president; dignified and confident.‚Äù
Currently demonstrated definition of presidential: attack the opponent like a savage beast to prove your worth but at the end of the fight you both have claw marks and wounds, and have not proved your worth. 

Historic purpose of American presidential debates: to tell the American  people what you aspire to do for them while president; sell yourself in the best light possible. (Kind of like crafting a resume).
Currently demonstrated purpose of American presidential debates: to convince the American people the opponent is a jackass and a liar and you shouldn‚Äôt vote for him; trash him going as below the belt as possible.

2020-10-17T15:22:57Z,@sammyhiggs4202,wW1lY5jFNcQ,"I thought id tune in to this comedy show but I am someone who has never voted and will never vote and thats for moral reasons. I will never listen to someone trying to guilt trip me into voting by saying by not voting I'm contributing to the evil candidate. In my eyes both parties do evil things.

 Neither side appeals to me. It seems like, when choosing one party or candidate vs the other, you have to accept a whole lot of stuff you don‚Äôt agree with along with the things you do agree with.¬†People in power are all crooks anyway. Consider Trump vs Biden.

¬†Both sides said the other was the devil. The truth? Both sides are right, at least on this one. Trump vs Biden brings up something else: how can I possibly be motivated to get out and vote if doing so means facing choices like THIS?Politics is just a whole lot of nastiness.¬†

People argue over it. People fight over it. Friendships are broken over it. Family members stop speaking to each other over it. Is this REALLY something you WANT to be involved with? I mean, the world is nasty and divisive enough as it is.¬†Who is REALLY ‚Äòright‚Äô?¬†

Both sides say their way is the ONLY way, and the other side is bad. But all in all, the economy can go bad with either side in power. Wars start with either side in power.¬†

Nobody REALLY seems to be able to get things right. Both sides just look like a bunch of incompetent fools who only THINK they are right. Meanwhile, they enjoy blaming EVERYTHING on the other side when things go wrong.¬†Too dogmatic.¬†

Both politicians and highly political folks put party rules and conventions above all else. Common sense and practicality mean NOTHING. Why would I want to partake in a system that puts party above common sense and (most of all) the people?¬†Too negative. Politics is all about making the other side look bad.¬†

Politicians spend VAST amounts of time and energy to do so. And negative campaigning has been the rule forever. The world is negative enough. Do we REALLY need to make things worse.¬†

Disinterest. There are MANY other things that interest me FAR more than politics.¬†It doesn‚Äôt really affect me. Neither side is going to do anything that will TRULY improve the life of the average person. Furthermore, there are other pursuits that benefit me FAR more than politics.",2020-10-17T15:33:52Z

If you want truth view video. Copy and paste watch and listen to it all before making mind up.
https://youtu.be/nIjaLmOTkEE
Wake up America do you want corruption in White House of money laundering, sex trafficking, pay offs you love ones killed and cover up like Barisma and pay offs Biden‚Äôs got there are documents out there in the senate.gov/ emails in there own words as well as charges. But they don‚Äôt want you to know this. There hiding the truth do you don‚Äôt see this and removed the site that had paperwork on it except I copied down so people will know.  The truth and we‚Äôre to find it. Go to : 
rudyscommensence.com  
This site is Giuliani and he has all the truth on his documents on their web page so you can see them directly with Giuliani. If you don‚Äôt believe me go to blazingpress.com look for their website for Giuliani their video clip that they had and it tells you exactly detailing this, in there own words Hunter and Biden emails , to where to go on the site and you can see all the emails and everything that they had on there that Biden and Hunter said and they‚Äôre covering pay offs to whole family as well as to Hunter and Biden on China, Russia and two other countries. On millions. Its all up and their trying to hide it so you don‚Äôt see it.  Let the truth be know! I cannot hide what millions have seen already but the video clips the people have not seen they are deleting them but the only thing is if you take a snapshot showing the site where people can go and look for it helps because I can‚Äôt erase the Snapchat‚Äòs. These webpages that I‚Äôve posted have seen by millions of people already and they cannot erase them. My suggestion is that you go and search them out and see for yourself with your own eyes. I don‚Äôt want a president in there that‚Äôs going to be lying to me that‚Äôs taking money and payback‚Äôs. And covering up the truth because they‚Äôre getting paid off and they got paid off more than burgers and I believe me because it‚Äôs all in the documents and their emails in your own words. Giuliani I‚Äôm his webpage has the documents that came off of a hard drive of Hunter Bidens. Hunter took his laptop and they get it corrected because he was having a problem with it or on it on the hard drive they found corruption and they turned it in to the law and they took it from there. That‚Äôs how He got caught and his father is trying to cover up his errors I did Niang it and lying about it when they‚Äôve got them already that he lied to the American people right on video. You guys are all being lied to when he says he does not know the truth about this he does he was fully aware of the situation. Because it talks about who the players are in all these emails and it tells how much people that paid off even they hasn‚Äôt even the Joe Biden‚Äòs brother is in there and one of the deals as well as his family and the Army there‚Äôs a letter they are directly from Hunter to Naomi telling it all. I don‚Äôt care which way you guys vote all I do is want to tell the truth and let the truth be out there so you guys know the truth and not for it to be covered up like they‚Äôre trying to do and pulling the sites. But like I said these websites that are on here they‚Äôve been seen by millions of people because he cites one of them is a very Christian site and has been seen by many of Christians across the country so people can go out there and look at it for themselves. Instead of reporting and half the truth This is the truth.",2023-10-13T07:09:03Z

When a people, A NATION of people, cannot survive their is a natural reaction. ANTIFA is merely the natural reaction of survival.  When you control the nations riches, it‚Äôs money, it‚Äôs means of survival, you control people‚Äôs reactions and beliefs.  And so this becomes the elitism last resort to invest in - humanity.  We can‚Äôt have the concept of fascism, when a nations poor lower middle to lower classes keep getting poorer.  This is an oxymoron unless the plans are set to turn a Constitutional nation and turn into a private nation, an aristocracy. 
The fascism is an ‚Äúanything goes concept‚Äù void of any form of governing body. It aims to take advantage of and intimidate impoverished segments of that nation‚Äôs poor, needy, its perceived, undesirable and demonize them and then bring them out into the streets, blame them and assassinate them. This has the potential of becoming a new modern day holocaust. 
This is the Confederacy rising up again. It‚Äôs a private nation refusing to become a Constitutional nation. An example of ‚Äúanything goes‚Äù is slavery and how fascism evolves to survival of the fittest style, predatorial society.     This leads to Christianity and Religion traditionally falling into persecution. 
Republicans know one thing MONEY and GREED as the CORE governing concept. This is simply put corruption and decay as its end result, and even an occult concept.     University political science professors, influential representatives need to step up and educate the public now, clout and influence is needed before ignorance follows this path even further. 
These concepts are built into the pathos of Trump and the party‚Äôs political wants. Elitism is what makes him and many like him pathologically inclined and empty hearted.

What would be a REAL democracy?
you wouldn't vote for people that mostly represent your wants and needs. you would vote directly for those wants and needs, i say we cut the middle man, with modern technology we no longer need to elect representatives, that mostly aligned with our vision.
people could vote directly on the amount of tax to pay and where these taxes would go.
At least in that way, you avoid ignorant blind votes and corruption.
We force the new generations to vote, even when no candidate is decent.
Even when they don‚Äôt even know a thing about them.
People who truly follow all that the candidate proposes are not the majority.

It is impossible to even think with his fucking mouth in the background ! and then complain everyone is against him including the moderator, when in fact the actual fact is that he can't stand hearing facts and truth, and he can't stand democracy itself ! fuck you Trump and please to god make this stop !",2020-10-15T13:27:07Z

They throw all kinds of lies and unsubstantiated bullshit at the person, all in an effort to make sure the American people don‚Äôt hear the truth. It‚Äôs a tactic used by Trump and all his people. Trump wouldn‚Äôt let Biden defend the lies about Hunter. Trump didn‚Äôt want ppl to hear the truth because all Trump does is spread lie and conspiracy theories 

Regarding his rallies ‚Äúso far we‚Äôve had no issues at all‚Äù.  Latest count 22 of his cabinet has it. 39 others have been traced to rose garden event. He gets back from hospital and Rips off his mask, after doing a whole huge photo op that cost tax payers 1.6 million and walks inside the WH where his 16 year old son lives who is negative. He had no respect for all the White House staff, secret service, marines etc.

Trump misrepresents all of Biden‚Äôs policies. Trump is such a fraud. He says dems party will over power him. Look at Trump. He can‚Äôt even negotiate or bring ppl Together. He screams at Schumer and Pelosi in previous meetings  at White House. He bad mouths everyone. He‚Äôs tweeting out so much shit about Fauci tonight. 

And he also is the one that said he was looking specifically for justices to overturn roe v Wade. He‚Äôs tweeted this over 61 times and here he is telling Biden that it‚Äôs not before court. Trump lies about his own policies. 

Trump and his administration are in court right now, it will be before Supreme Court week after election to overturn ACA. He has no plan in place thus millions will lose their insurance and then be denied any because trump HAS NOT covered pre existing. He has no plan people. This means babies and children, the elderly and disabled will die. Let that wash over you. ‚Äú

‚ÄúYou just lost the left‚Äù. He‚Äôs so full of it. He didn‚Äôt even go to Biden‚Äôs campaign website where it lays out all of Biden‚Äôs  policies. He didn‚Äôt prepare for this debate. He‚Äôs too lazy and too busy tweeting and worrying about himself and being held accountable for all his crimes and corruption. 

Trump doesn‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs on his own website. Remember in 2016 debates he was going to bring the insurance companies together and compete against other and out of state insurance companies would insure ppl. It‚Äôs been almost 5 years. Nothing. No plan. He‚Äôs been too busy golfing and tweeting and stealing from tax payers and the government. Too busy obsessing everyday about FBI investigating his crimes. All he cares about is himself. Not anyone else. 

He says he‚Äôs saving social security and Medicare but his 2021 budget shows he is cutting both by over $900 billion. Trump lies about his own policies.

Both Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson announced in last 24 hours the vaccine is on hold indefinitely due to ppl having adverse reactions to the vaccine. Trumps  so full of crap and he wasn‚Äôt kidding or saying sarcastically to inject bleach. He was dead serious. Go watch the video. 

He‚Äôs a criminal, a con man, a bankrupt failure as a businessman, has never paid income taxes and he‚Äôs compromised by our enemies. He abandoned the Kurds one of our greatest allies for Putin and turkey president.",2020-10-14T10:15:39Z

2020-10-14T00:14:26Z,@sweeettat,wW1lY5jFNcQ,"Writing as a concerned citizen of the United States of America: CSPAN networks, why have you only been showing Joe Biden ‚Äúrallies‚Äù and not President Trump‚Äôs rallies now? I‚Äôve watched all 3 channels for over a year now and I have noticed a slight change in the phone calls and especially broadcasting certain political speeches and ignoring others. Not even a few months ago I‚Äôve noticed that when it came to viewers calling into the show who spoke on support of President Trump especially during the Impeachment sham, those calls were nothing but support for him! Literally every call was all kinds of American citizens calling in SUPPORT of President Trump. It was nothing but Republican supporters. BUT NOW: Your network is screening calls. Instead of a ‚Äúfree line‚Äù, you are now screening callers in order: Republican, Democrat, Independent. What happened to the free, unbiased, and uncensored look at what is going on when it comes to citizens waking up to the scam from politicians and political parties President Trump has opened up our eyes too? What got tired of hearing too much support from We the American People on the best President we have ever been so grateful and lucky to have? Why screen the calls now? See, after one of your ‚Äúfair, unbiased, uncensored‚Äù correspondents (Steve Scully) who was SUPPOSE TO BE the ‚Äúfair, unbiased,uncensored‚Äù MODERATOR for the 2nd Presidential debate was exposed for basically being the fraud of what most call ‚Äúfair and unbiased‚Äù colluding with a total biased, very hateful, and nasty Never-Trumper Anthony Scaramucci(who was fired after only 3 days on the job in the ‚ÄúWhite House‚Äù;hurt feelings and revenge doesn‚Äôt even describe him)heads of your network literally changed the roll-outs of your line-ups. Because now you are not even showing Trump rallies and speeches which come on usually around 7pm when most Americans, but INSTEAD will show Joe Biden‚Äôs boring and unaffected ‚Äúrallies/speeches‚Äù THROUGHOUT the day?! What is up with that? Why all of a sudden there are certain aspects of your networks that were changed after being exposed? I‚Äôm writing this on behalf of millions of Americans who are sick and tired of the RESISTANCE! Yes your network is now part of the establishment corporate media elitists machine that pumps out broadcasts of propaganda that only reflect what your own personal beliefs and opinions that are can be traced to total authoritarian and dictatorship. What I mean by that: ‚Äúonly ONE SIDE of the political spectrum should be shown! to only distort TRUTH and REALITY to the American People!‚Äù...This is a huge wake-up call. This leads to very dangerous tactics that will eventually put peoples lives at risk in the end! It‚Äôs NOT RIGHT TO HIDE TRUTH AND FACTS from the American People! You are suppose to broadcast and let the American People DECIDE for themselves! The corruption that is now bleeding through every aspect of our lives in this country is unbelievable. And now your once respected network has fallen from that and it is such a shame. All I have to say is do better. Do and Be Better than this.",2020-10-14T00:14:26Z

I think he had something to do with it cause if he was going to perhaps go on with his plan with Medicare It would cost a lot and mainly kids and old people have Medicare and those are the type of people dieing.

I am an essential worker whose job requires me to physically occupy an office with many people. Our customers are incensed that we are so far behind in providing services. One of the reasons we can't keep up is that coworkers are constantly stuck at home awaiting the results of COVID tests or because they have been ordered to quarantine. Another reason we can't keep up Is that maintaining a six foot distance from one another in our cramped office severely restricts our freedom of movement.  
The first time I was ordered to quarantine, was because my daughter had contact with a fellow Emergency Medical Technician who tested positive. Although she was tested weekly and none of her test results were positive, I was still ordered into quarantine. This time she had one positive test followed by two negative tests. We were ordered to remain in quarantine even after the two negative tests. We were also told that we would not be released from quarantine regardless of any testing we underwent. 
If you exercise your right not to socially distance and wear a mask, please also exercise your right to not obtain medical treatment

I see comments like one of them will be President this hilarious and it is hilarious only because we allowed a person like Trump to become president. Around the 40 minute mark I thought Trump was just childish. He is arguing with guy who trying to ask him a question and he wont allow him to ask the whole question. What I took from this is that Trump will never care about what you have to say matter fact he wont even let you voice your opinion. What makes you think he will care about what the American people have to say or their cries? He will just do what he wants as sporadically and reckless as he wants . 1 example he wants get rid of Obama care yet has no alternative plan laid but says we can go cheaper overseas I like Biden stance on keeping things American 2 he didn't include lowest earners in his Pandemic relief package which stated people who get less than 100$ of unemployment would not receive the extra money. Why not include the lowest? How do you survive on 100$ a week? I feel sorry for anyone in that position and know I'm blessed not to be in that position. 3 its almost 4 years now and we still have not seen the tax return and its believed he paid 750$ on federal taxes I paid more federal taxes than that and he made millions  I didn't even make 75K last year. I could go on forever but lastly the 4th thing I look at both candidates character and there is no question who has better morale values.,2020-10-12T04:51:53Z

‚ÄúIN Searching For A New Enemy To Unite Us, We Came Up With The Threat Of Global Warming‚Äù

‚ÄúThe common enemy of humanity is man.
In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up
with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming,
water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these
dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through
changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome.
The real enemy then, is humanity itself.‚Äú

Biden tried to focus on Covid 19, but I don't believe he can do grrat thing to control the spread and deaths because no one can help or even the vaccine, except each individual can save and protect him/her. Remember many countries are controlling the virus very well. Just agree with him to the point wearing masks sooner can save thousands. However, do you think Trump can force people to wear face masks. People protested to repond on businesses close and  wear face masks in public. Even now there are so many people are not wearing masks in public. And kids in school refuse to wear it too.

He blames China for lying and downplaying the virus but that is exactly what he did to Americans. Dangerous Donny was so distracted by covid-19 that he golfed on January 18 and 19, February 1+15th, March 7+8th and had rallies on January 9, 14, 28, 30 and Feb 10, 19, 20, 21 and the 28th.  Here is a timeline of the President‚Äôs statements in regard to corona virus COVID-19 that were designed to save his reelection and not protect Americans. All of July and August he has played golf while 1000+ Americans die a day. That is the cruel incompetence you still support. 
January 22: ‚ÄúWe have it totally under control. It‚Äôs one person coming in from China. It‚Äôs going to be just fine.‚Äù
February 2: ‚ÄúWe pretty much shut it down coming in from China.‚Äù Yet 30,000 people still traveled from China to America in that time and 400,000 traveled from Europe infecting Americas East Coast. 
*February 7 ""This is deadly stuff,"" Trump told Woodward. Far worse than any flu. In public trump continues to lie about the virus.

I have always been a republican, but without mattering to what party you support you cannot deny that Trump behaves as a rude, arrogant person, tyrant, narcissist, authoritarian and intolerant with all that is different from his standards. What 'leader' was behaving this way? As the majority of the Cuban Americans, I suffered myself the consequences of a 'leader' like that. This 'leader' was Fidel Castro who forced me to leave my homeland in 1983 as political refugee. Trump behaves very similar to as
Castro and Chavez was behaving although his political affiliation and circumstances are different. Whoever that have suffered under these dictators can recognize the attitude and personality of a dictator and Trump has dictator's personality, behaves as them. Trump has not turned his government into a dictatorship only because he is stopped by the magnificent constitution and
democratic system we have in this great nation. Also several trustworthy psychologists and universities have affirmed that Trump has a disorder narcissist of the personality, which is clear if you study the features of this disorder and the behavior of Trump. A president like that is a risk for the peace, social stability, democracy and progress of any country. Please, do not be political blind fanatics and do not repeat everything what they see and hear in Internet, instead use your own reasoning to analyze facts, history and what the behavior of Trump shows us.

This eventuated into a lot of senseless talks. Trump fights with the cockiness of Muhamed Ali and takes no prisoners. Now you would wonder why they were not in crystal clear isolation booths that gave them 2 minutes of uninterrupted speech rather than to see them in a cock-fight. I guess it's all about ratings and money with the Media, but it muddles and confuses the people of America. Trump is a businessman and looks at everything through those lenses.

Trump claims to have lowered prescription drug costs 80-90% my mother has cancer and Im a Diabetic and we take quite a few prescription medications, and i can tell you first hand and say ""what a load of crap,"". 

You didn't build the greatest economy in American history you inherited that economy from Obama and you ""tanked"" it.

""Elections have consequences"" after 3 in a half years the American people are quite aware of that.

Impeachment Hoax? You mean when the Republican Senate prevents witnesses to testify against Trump (Obstruction of Justice) to protect him?

Did anyone ever consider how many people's doctors appointed would be interrupted or even outrightly cancelled because of this foolishness? 

My brother was scheduled to see the doctors on this day at CC, hes in need of a kidney removal (he has a hereditary disease which essentially causes acute inflammation of his kidneys, they are about five times the normal size as they should be)- it was VERY hard to get him into the clinic. Traffic around the clinic was atrocious, NO ONE could give us correct directions, my brother vomited several times while we drove around Cleveland Clinic, three streets were virtually closed completely in respect to this stupid debate and after all of this we found out an hour later or so that my brother's appointed had been changed. Pure BS. 

Also let me add this, I live very close to Cleveland Clinic, we were not permitted to park on our own street, there was literally three or four tow trucks parked at the mouth of my street waiting to tow cars away. I had to run out of my apartment to stop the tow truck from taking my van away, my little brother lives in Lorain Ohio, I have to drive there to get him several times each month so he can see the doctors about his kidney operation, he is very sick, this condition of his took my father's like, I have to relive this nightmare all over again with my brother; listening to him vomit all night reminds me of how I had to listen to my father through his battle with this disease (he too had no kidneys). It is an understatement for me to say that it was a very stressful day- By the Grace of Allah the police officer there told the tow man to release my van although I still got a $25 ticket all of this on the day that my brother had to see the doctor's for his operation, Lord knows what I would have done if my van was impounded because there is no way my brother could walk to Cleveland Clinic he is simply unfit physically to make it. 

This is how we citizens are treated in respect to a presidential debate... Why couldn't we have been given a cash credit voucher for the day and asked us to park elsewhere- $50 would have been more of an incentive for us to park elsewhere instead of towing our cars away then we have to pay about $200 to get our cars back. You think these men are supposed to be leaders of our government but this government don't care about us- my brother could've died on the day of this debate because we couldn't get into the clinic for his operation summary...

Biden keeps saying they are here to help, if the government didn't stomp around out of control we wouldn't need help and if we do, we damn sure don't want the help from corrupt government, main reason the Constitution was written to keep the government from ruining your life and freedoms.

But idk just hearing him talk, even though he is interruping, his points actually make sense, and biden is just trying to appeal to the American people without actually proving why he's a good candidate. Donald Trump is trying to force his opinions because he wants to be heard and shutting down lies that Biden keeps talking about because you can tell he gets nervous everytime Trump shuts it down with things he knows about. I don't know if what Trump is saying is 100% truth but being 1 hour 15 minutes in so far, Biden would not help this country, and Trump actually seems to be doing something, regardless of ALL his flaws (which are tremendous) but if I had to choose between who to get us through these next few years, its gonna be Trump and I don't think I would have ever said that.

2020-10-10T22:17:10Z,@renestar99,wW1lY5jFNcQ,"Navy Seals on Joe Biden [COPY AND SHARE]
Lest We Forget:
When he was the Vice President, he did the most unthinkable thing fora man in his position. He revealed the names and the unit that killed Bin Laden

""On May 3 2011, at a national event in Washington, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. did the unthinkable - He publicly revealed the identity of the special-operations unit responsible for bin Laden's killing, just to show that he ""was in the know"".

His reckless action put at risk the lives of every member of Seal Team 6. The Taliban and other jihadists eager to avenge bin Laden now knew which unit to target. Stunned and shocked, Seal Team Six members immediately realized they were going to be hunted by al Qaeda
sympathizers.

Soon after Biden's reckless idiotic speech, an American CH47 Chinook was shot down by a rocket propelled grenade in the Tangi Valley, Maidan Wardak Province, Afghanistan, all 38 aboard were killed including most of Seal Team Six, this incident became known as Extortion 17.

After Biden had let the identification out, and before the Chinook was shot down, members of Seal Team 6 had called their families and told them to wipe out all connection to them, including social media, and disassociate themselves as far away from them as possible because they too would be in grave danger as the Taliban would attempt to find them in retaliation....  And Biden, well he didn't even work up a sweat over any of it, and was just too stupid to realize what he had done.

I added a couple links here for those who want proof. It's easy enough to look up the information yourself. These are just a few of many.

https://youtube/lMA1T9QWEI4
https://special-ops.org/./the-betrayal-of-navy-seal-team-6/.

""Someone said.....   Well that's just Joe.!""   Really?   No, this traitor revealed the names and signed the death warrants of America's finest warriors and never looked back.  
Sorry, if you disagree, but he is not worthy of consideration as our President and Commander-in-Chief!!!    Wake up.  America can't afford to have this moron as our President!

I think his rudeness here did not do any good for him nor for Joe and the moderator.

Again I tried to be impartial. Just seemed to me like Biden's claims were less inflammatory and more aligned with a sort of ""multi-truth"".",2020-10-10T19:37:21Z

Wait isnt that their job its what they do (Media). They can make a fictional movie if they wanted too. Or use their own source like other shows they own. Ridiculous how someone can pin all the covid deaths on the president whom actually acted  pretty fast debating with officials whether or not that covid was serious enough to start emergency airline shut downs. Also there wasnt enough info being shared from China. Thats why some people that were contiguous would had slipped by already anyways aka transportaton airlines 3 day travel  and meetings. Especially when US companies worked close with China (meetings and such). Covid 19 probably spread for days b4 anyone knew anything or shared any crazy bio accident report...80% of what the dems do is point their fingers at the President and twist his words around after he said something already or did something already since 2016 election. 20% lazy they only reply to whats thrown at them  I havent heard them come up with any great plans besides whats already taking place....The president  personally should had been more serious about himself and his party with covid tho. 
Everyone was excited about Obama care at 1st, after a while everybody hated it. Didn't  go well.Trumps right bout that otherwise why would both parties  be trying to fix it. Most of what the president said he will do, he did and moved on to get more done. There's proof. Even when he was being blocked by other powers or dems he acted upon doing what he said he'll do. He's not perfect but I'd rather have a leader for the country, then partly letting problems take over or slide by. Talking about economy and the plans the 2 parties have.  Excluding covid.19 which would had snuck to the USA anyways bcus what I described earlier.  Not enough info spread quickly enough b4 people with contact of the first cycle of covid.19.",2020-10-10T10:26:38Z

Why didn't Joe Biden run for pres in 2016? I know the answer do you? Why did Joe Biden select Kamala Harris as VP after she accused him of being a racist during the primaries and saying she believed the women who accused him of being too ""touchy, feely""?  I know the answer do you? Why does Nancy Pelosi want to invoke the 25th amendment to remove Trump with less than 30 days until the election? Especially if Joe Biden is so far ahead in the polls? I know the answer do you? AND did Nancy Pelosi finally learn how to wash and dry her own hair? I don't know the answer do you??",2020-10-09T14:06:56Z

It's always fascinated me how unwilling and uncomfortable we are to face the truth. Liberals have created an archetype of evil out of him, and it prevents any _real_ curiosity about the state of the country.

They've made a mockery out of him and accused him of being so many disturbing things, which-- frankly, could get them killed in other countries. People who claim to be ""liberal"" and tolerant of others, yet make fun of his appearance, demeanor, wife, kids, you name it...

The lack of disrespect towards him is pathetic and nothing to boast or be proud of. It takes courage to speak the truth and most people are cowards.",2020-10-09T05:14:35Z

Mark my words, if biden wins, you will be serving the UN and their agenda just like UN-occupied Canada is. They will use your country as a storage camp for migrants. Your government will tell its white citizens to stop having babies to save the environment, while shipping in big families of refugees with pregnant mothers to replace your dying population with declining birth rates. the war on drugs is still in effect, so in other words, no progress whatsoever, its a scam by big corporations and world government, and youre stupid for falling for it.",2020-10-09T02:58:07Z

2020-10-09T01:46:06Z,@JohnSmith-zo6ir,wW1lY5jFNcQ,"COVID-19 RESPONSE BY TRUMP.
With regards to Trump and Pence debating the response to COVID-19,  they MUST make the distinction between the Federal response by Trump and the Democrat State Governors responses or lack thereof to COVID-19. 

This same pattern is true of law and order.

On COVID-19, 15% of the national deaths come from New York. LA's contribution is high as well. Both are run by Democrat Governors. 

Cuomo did not even know his PPE stocks and was demanding stock from Trump when he hadn't even deployed the stock he had. Trump pointed this out to Cuomo.

Likewise Cuomo's gross mismanagement of resources extended into his poor strategic decision making by sending sick elderly people into old age homes and certain death.

On the other hand look at Trump's amazing handling of COVID-19 at a Federal level which is his responsibility. 

Not only did he mobilise national private sector resources to manufacture locally made ventilators and PPE, but in ONE week he had the military build a 1000 bed medical hospital in NY and simultaneously deployed two 1000 bed naval hospitals to NY and LA. 

Cuomo never even used those resources which shows his lack of understanding of the virus forecasts and his lack of understanding of his states needs and current resources on hand.

The naval ship was hardly used. Only 11 patients were admitted out of a 1000 bed capacity and the military hospital was never used to its full capacity.

Trump sent Cuomo all the ventilators he requested and needless to say they were not all used either.

In fact there was so many excess ventilators that NY had enough to supply other states in the USA and there was even enough to export to other countries.

Trump's response at a Federal level, which is his responsibility,  was exemplarary.

The response at a state level by Democrat Governors was abysmal and that is 100% their responsibility. 

Trump and Pence need to make that distinction clear. Ditto for law and order.",2020-10-09T01:46:06Z

Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, Bitch, fuck Donald Trump (It's for our people)
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump (Ain't nobody else gon' speak up, we gon' speak up)
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, bitch, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
I got a question
How'd he make it this far? How the fuck did it begin?
A Trump rally sounds like Hitler in Berlin
Or KKK shit, now I'm goin' in
I'm just sayin' what's real, I don't give a fuck who I offend
'Cause it's gotta be said, it's gotta be said
It's off the top like the toupee on Donald Trump's head
This man's not peaceful, racism's evil
This man hates Muslims, that's a billion fuckin' people
If truth be told, Donald is a terrorist
Reasons why the world's got a problem with Americans
The fuck is goin' on? People just passed
A mass murder happened, you said thanks for the congrats
You tryna get your votes up, you don't got class
Orlando was a tragedy, you react fast
And then made it 'bout you, to boost your campaign
It's goin' all bad if he wins this damn thing
Man America is fucked if he's next up
Take a day to undo what Obama fixed up
It's Young Gerald so you know who said it
And Ivanka can get it, straight up
Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, bitch, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Oh we ridin', check it
Now, we protest when we see the tour bus (Bang, bang)
Too scared to get out, that's why the door is shut (Bang, bang)
Your politics are like a Starburst pack (Why?)
Nobody fucks with the orange one (Biatch!)
Bannin' all Muslims? Aiight, bool (This guy)
What if we ban all the white dudes?
Because a couple have run up in trenchcoats and rifles
And killed in the name of Jesus Christ at the high school
How 'bout we stop sellin' automatic guns?
You got rich 'cause your daddy gave you automatic funds
Add it up, you an automatic punk, what it is?
I'm just tryna make America great again! (Mothafucka)
Party in the streets when Hillary wins
If she don't, my girl's half Canadian
Actually nah, I'm not gonna stay with them
I got an eagle on my arm, I'm a patriot
I'mma stay right here, I ain't livin' in fear
With my people who are Muslims, Mexican and queer
And we ain't gonna let you fuck up four years
Ain't gonna let you fuck up for years
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, bitch, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump (Send it over)
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump (Ain't nobody feelin' your ass)
Yeah, bitch, fuck Donald Trump (Ain't nobody feelin' you)
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump (Here we go again)
Thought I was makin' songs just to ride to?
But come to find out your own kind don't even like you
Macklemore don't like you, G-Eazy don't like you
The rest weenies, they scared to say it, but they don't like you
Obama don't like you, Michelle don't like you
Been tryna make it to one of your rallies but I ain't have time to, punk
Piss on your golf course just to find you
Like where you hidin' at? Who you lyin' to?
Fuck your get rich scheme, I've been ballin' out
You're too old, you keep lyin', that's why your hair fallin' out
Donald Trump, call him out, KKK supporter
His favorite phrase, ""Deport 'em, "" how the fuck y'all endorse him?
Since America is fucked up anyway
Give Obama a third term, that's what plenty say
Just left Texas, hit the stage for a couple thousand
And had your same color people hollerin'
Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, bitch, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, bitch, fuck Donald Trump

The general population will never ultimately know.  Joe was removed with the last election vote and I don't have to say much about Trump as its all been said.  Look at the policies - - look at the facts on the ground --- if Democrats get in just how much will the Republican populace be as badly mistreated as Trump (deserving or undeserving) - will Joe really be a president for Republicans and Democrats?   In Canada, when one party wins, then policies and decisions are made to suppress the opposing perspectives.   Clearly the United States has deeper problems than any party can fix, the culture wars and deep divisions in the country between Liberal and conservative are still there; America is struggling with battling with a social liberal experiment for its future.",2020-10-08T22:29:19Z

When BIDEN was the Vice President, he did the most unthinkable thing for a man in his position: He revealed the Seal's names and the unit that killed Bin Laden! ""On May 3 2011, at a national vent in Washington, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. PUBLICLY revealed the identity of the special-operations unit responsible for Bin Laden's killing, just to show that he ""was in the know"".

His reckless action put at risk the lives of every member of Seal Team 6.  The Taliban and other jihadists eager to avenge bin Laden now knew which unit to target.  Stunned and shocked, Seal Team Six members immediately realized they are going to be hunted by al Qaeda sympathizers.  Soon after Biden's reckless idiotic speech, an American CH47 Chinook was shot down by a rocket propelled grenade in the Tangi Valley, Maidan Wardak Province, Afghanistan; all 38 aboard were killed, including most of Seal Team Six, this incident became known as Extortion 17.

After Biden had let the identification out and before the Chinook was shot down, members of Seal Team 6 had called their families and told them to wipe out all connection to them, including social media, and disassociate themselves as far away from them as possible because they too would be in grave danger as the Taliban would attempt to find them in retaliation....?? 

And Biden, well he didn't even work up a sweat over any of it, and was just too stupid to realize what he had done.

Here are a couple links for those who want proof.  It's easy enough to look up the information yourself. 

These are just a couple of many. https://youtu.be/.../the-betrayal-of-navy-seal.../.%C2%A0

Each candidate is given a switch on a timer and a half hour each. If the candidate hits the switch, he mutes the other guy's microphone and turns on his own and his own timer. When his time runs out, his microphone and his mute switch automatically shut off, the other guy's timer and microphone automatically reactivate, and when his time runs out, the debate is over. You're wasting time if you mute the other guy and don't say anything. And you can't say anything yourself without using time.

The Supreme Court ruled just a few months ago that in the area of employment, people can't be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or gender identity however,  it's still legal to evict and refuse service in more than half the states... And when people are literally driven out of their community (as has happened in Pence's home town due to his Religious Restoration efforts), that is segregation.  Also, the Biden administration has come out in such strong favor of LGBTQ+ rights and the fact that his party didn't even fight to bring up the subject kinda sucks :( That would have been a HUGE win to the campaign!",2020-10-08T14:56:34Z

Trump falsely claimed that Biden supports the Medicare for All plan. He never did.
Biden got it wrong when he claimed there was ‚Äú15% less violence‚Äù during his time in office than today. The violent crime rate dropped under Trump.
Biden said billionaires have gotten $300 to $400 billion wealthier during the pandemic, but he is referring to a study that ignored the financial losses by wealthy stockholders early in the pandemic.
Both candidates gave potentially misleading impressions of when Americans can expect a COVID-19 vaccine.
Biden said 10 million people lost their employer-sponsored insurance during the pandemic, but the study he relies upon also said all but 3.5 million of them would regain insurance from another source.
Biden said Trump‚Äôs Supreme Court nominee has ‚Äúwritten ‚Ä¶ that she thinks the Affordable Care Act is not constitutional.‚Äù Not quite, though she faulted a 2012 opinion upholding the law.
Trump claimed that ‚Äúdrug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%.‚Äù Actually it‚Äôs not clear what the impact of his executive orders will be.
Trump said Biden called military members ‚Äústupid bastards,‚Äù which Biden denied. The vice president did use those words while addressing troops overseas in 2016, but his campaign has said it was in jest.
Trump wrongly said Biden ‚Äúforgot the name‚Äù of his college. Biden in 2019 said he ‚Äústarted out of ‚Ä¶ Delaware State,‚Äù but a university official said Biden was referring to announcing his Senate bid on campus.
Biden falsely claimed that Trump didn‚Äôt try to send experts to China early in the coronavirus pandemic.
Biden wrongly claimed that the United States has ‚Äúa higher deficit with China now than we did before‚Äù in talking about trade. The deficit is actually lower.
Trump claimed that in relaxing the Obama administration‚Äôs more stringent fuel economy standards, cars would be $3,500 cheaper. Even going by the administration‚Äôs analysis, that‚Äôs inflated.",2020-10-08T14:17:10Z

He did attend but nothing was debated. He bought only his boorishness his insults and not much else except belligerence. So just read of Trump's withdrawal from the next scheduled debate. 
Oh well - a perfect opportunity not to answer any questions either in proposed virtual debate. I wonder about the 3rd and last proposed debate. But I will not forecast if he will take part.  C-Span's Steve Scully was  scheduled to be the moderator?  I would have watched that had it happened. Not going to waste time watching this Video Tape.
It has Trump showing us all how to not answer a single question satisfactorily.

He does not care for your health and safety- and that's why he didn't tell you about Covid. Ask yourselves why would a man who spent 70 years only trying (and failing) to make himself richer want to suddenly help you out? He had even made sure to pay less tax than many of you.

Biden, who is certainly more refrained and polite
(but had his interrupts too), reminds me of the tried-and-true politician. He spoke as a campaigner and salesman in a rehearsed and more artificial manner.  There were moments that I could see how some people can relate to Trump's shoot-from-the-hip manner and moments that I cringed from his childish behavior and mannerisms. Likewise, at times I cringed at Biden for appearing so plastic and others for seeming a tad more genuine.  All in all for me, the take home was... high entertainment.

EDIT: without taking any sides here, I found the moderator much too biased in his questions, acting more like a journalist than anything else. For instance, regarding health insurance/Obama care, his question was actually an opinionated accusation disguised as a question. Then the moderator lost control, as both came to insults (""liar-liar-liar"") and such without the moderator interfering and recalling them to oppose arguments rather than throwing free accusations at each others. The kind of chaos which ensued was ineluctable: no ""contender"" would accept such a thing against him(her)self from a supposedly ""neutral"" moderator, and from then on the strategy couldn't have been anything else, on both sides. Because they were here to debate and win: to serve themselves and self-interests in ""wining"" the power of Presidency, before serving the American public and their democratic free-will with sound arguments (such ""debate"" sets us very far from the dynamics of constructive and informative ""discussion"").",2020-10-08T05:39:02Z

But the guy cares and wants to be somebody. And he isnt controlled by lobbyists and shit like that. He gives a shit. That's why I vote for him. Everyone has to have some kind of self interest.  And I dont blame him for it at all. I want someone in there that isnt controlled that can make a difference. And that is exactly what he is doing. He keeps his promises. He stands strong. As a leader that's what a leader is supposed to do.  Life is tough. Everyone equally has the risk of getting covid. When you go to the gas station when you go to the grocery store. Living in fear is not something I am going to do. Am I gonna wear a mask yes. I will. But I refuse to live in fear. Bring it on covid. If it's my time it's my time. Biden is too old. He's a good dude but he is past the line and def is going to be controlled. Dont make the mistake of letting someone be president that is going to be controlled all because you dont agree with something that trump has said that you dont agree with. That's how I look at it.

In fact, it wasn't even a contest. Joe Biden insulted Donald Trump or used foul language 26 times to Donald Trump's 7. Watch the video compilation of the insults and decide for yourself.""

We all know that there's a lot of cheating going on and that shouldnt be our concern. Our concern should be whether our neighbors know that they are loved by you and that You teach them that they are loved by Jesus Christ and that He died for their sins.  If Obama cant destroy Gods country or the fake news or all the bad presidents before great President Donald Trump then why worry.  Americans, we all know that this is the most important election for our freedom especially the freedom of believing in Our Savior Jesus Christ. Please do vote Donald Trump but do realize that Satan was already defeated by Jesus Christ when he died and rose the 3rd day. Lets focus on prayer, having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ,  reading Gods word and on spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ.  Lets not lose that focus.  Ive seen lots of great christian people get really upset at liberals/democrats but they need saving just as much as we needed saving. They have blinders on their eyes. This isnt a flesh and blood battle, this is a spiritual battle. A president doesnt save us Only Jesus Christ Saves Us! We all need saving from these messes but these messes came from people.  Another president cant fix a mess that only Jesus can fix. SIN!!! Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved. Amen Hallelujah we are yours Lord.  There will be a time very soon that EVERY knee will bow, EVERY tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. To God be the Glory!",2020-10-07T05:16:10Z

2020-10-06T23:12:19Z,@deesott5123,wW1lY5jFNcQ,"Nothing can compare with all that is ours in Christ when we find salvation. Forgiveness. Justification. Adoption. Eternal life. What a glorious life the Gospel offers to those who are searching for purpose and meaning or to those who have found that materialism and sensual pleasure are not the answer to the deepest yearnings of the heart.

The crowning glory of salvation is promised when we enter into the presence of the King. We have a home in heaven reserved for us and awards that await us. No wonder the Gospel is ‚Äúgood news.‚Äù

Unfortunately, many people today have distorted the meaning of salvation, saying that it means only political, social and economic liberation in this life. Certainly, Christians should be concerned about injustice and do what they can to promote a more just world. But lasting and complete liberation from social injustice will come only when Jesus Christ returns to establish His Kingdom. Biblical salvation is far deeper, because it gets to the root of our problem‚Äìthe problem of sin. Only Christ can change the human heart and replace greed and hate with compassion and love.

Do you understand God‚Äôs plan of salvation?
There are certain points we all need to understand about the heart of the Good News of Christ.

First, all are sinners and stand under the judgment of God. ‚ÄúFor all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God‚Äù (Romans 3:23, NIV). We might believe that we are good enough to win God‚Äôs favor or that we can perform certain religious acts to counterbalance our bad deeds. But the Bible states that we are all condemned, for ‚Äúthere is no one righteous, not even one‚Äù (Romans 3:10, NIV).

Second, we need to understand what Christ has done to make our salvation possible. God loves us, and Christ came to make forgiveness and salvation possible. What did He do? He died on the cross as the complete sacrifice for our sins. He took upon Himself the judgment that we deserve.

Third, we need to respond to God‚Äôs work. God in His grace offers us the gift of eternal life. But like any gift, it becomes ours only when we take it.

We must repent of our sins. Repentance carries with it the idea of confession, sorrow, turning and changing. We cannot ask forgiveness over and over again for our sins and then return to those sins, expecting God to forgive us. We must turn from our practice of sin as best we know how, and turn by faith to Christ as our Lord and Savior. ‚ÄúIt is by grace you have been saved, through faith‚Äìand this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God‚Äìnot by works, so that no one can boast‚Äù (Ephesians 2:8-9, NIV). Christ invites us to come to Him, and God has promised, ‚Äúto all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God‚Äù (John 1:12, NIV).

Fourth, we must understand the cost of coming to Christ and following Christ. Jesus constantly called upon those who would follow Him to count the cost. A person must determine to leave his sins behind and turn from them. Some people may be unwilling to do so. And there may be other costs as well when we decide to follow Christ. In some cultures, a person who turns to Christ may be disowned by family, alienated from social life, imprisoned or even killed.

The ultimate cost of true discipleship is the cost of renouncing self: self-will, self-plans, self-motivations. Christ is to be Lord of our lives. Jesus declared, ‚ÄúIf anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me‚Äù (Luke 9:23, NIV). Jesus does not call us to a life of selfish comfort and ease‚ÄìHe calls us to a battle! He calls us to give up our own plans and to follow Him without reserve‚Äìeven to death.

Yes, it costs to follow Christ. But it also costs not to follow Christ. It cost the Apostle Paul the prestige of a high-level position in the Jewish nation. But he declared, ‚Äúwhatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things‚Äù (Philippians 3:7-8, NIV). Christ calls men and women not only to trust Him as Savior, but also to follow Him as Lord.

Fifth, salvation is intimately linked to the cross. The man who hung there between two thieves was without sin. His virgin birth, by the miraculous intervention of the Holy Spirit, meant that He did not inherit a sinful human nature. Neither did He commit any sin during His lifetime. Mary gave birth to the only perfect child. He became the only perfect man. As such, He was uniquely qualified to put into action God‚Äôs plan of salvation for mankind.

Why was Calvary‚Äôs cross so special, so different from hundreds of other crosses used for Roman executions? It was because on that cross Jesus suffered the punishment for sin that we all deserve. He was our Substitute. He suffered the judgment and condemnation of death that our sinful nature and deeds deserve. ‚ÄúGod made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God‚Äù (2 Corinthians 5:21, NIV).

Paul wrote to the church at Corinth, ‚ÄúI resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified‚Äù (1 Corinthians 2:2, NIV). Paul knew there was a built-in power in the cross and the resurrection.

I remember a meeting early in my ministry when I walked away from where I was preaching, disheartened and disappointed. A businessman who was with me asked me if I knew what was wrong. I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it until he told me. ‚ÄúBilly,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt preach the cross!‚Äù

He was right. The message had been theologically sound, and I had preached it as best I knew how. But that vital ingredient was missing. I learned my lesson. From that day to this, I have never preached an evangelistic message without pointing the listeners to the cross.

Finally, faith is essential for salvation. But we must be absolutely clear on what we mean when we speak of ‚Äúsalvation by faith.‚Äù There are various kinds of belief or faith, and not all are linked to salvation. In the New Testament, faith means more than intellectual belief. It involves trust and commitment. I may say that I believe a bridge will hold my weight. But I really believe it only when I commit myself to it and walk across it. Saving faith involves an act of commitment and trust, in which I commit my life to Jesus Christ and trust Him alone as my Savior and Lord.",2020-10-06T23:12:19Z

Trump is also somewhat for restricting the 2nd amendment but not nearly as radically as biden. They both tossed too many insults ""clown"" ""too dumb"" too much mudslinging to even be called a debate. I Believe both sides are severely horrid, too bad we can't get a cantidatr that is progun, wants a mask mandate, wants to allow civilians to buy n95s and the other variants other countries have produced like the kn95 (chinese), and other things.

Biden feels superior over all the American people of the United states.  Biden is just an ass hole with his political mouth he has for 47 years of bullshit politics.   This Biden has a 47 years closet full of horrible things.  This man has done more harm than Trump.  Trump has tried to get this country to obey the laws of the Constitution not by destroying it by those liberal socialist democrats.  Remember Obama is running the democrats and Biden as his puppet.   Wake up people.   Have you seen any other president involved with this election.   Only the gay president Obama been  seriously involved.    The media is against Trump.

No matter how bad this debate was, its purpose is extremely questionable, and important for democrats!!! If is true that what Mr. Trump received almost immediately after the test (highly toxic drugs administered by MILITRAY, which have NOTHING to do with any infection, similar to Fauci's AIDS drugs!!!) will help him to 'recover' hours after highly questionable tests, then we all are in big trouble! This entire debate facility if equipped with 5G can cause any disease in anyone exposed to the wi-fi radiation, and military knows it best, as always! 5G is a phased array capable of sending high frequency beam in very specific direction, only. It is a weapon!  Here some thoughts on covid-19 details (from molecular biology stand point, assuming covid-19 existsand what Fauci tells us is true???). GPCR are proteins which have this THREE AMINO ACIDS LONG D/ERY motif, (aspartic/glutamic acid)-arginine-tyrosine, which represent, I'd call it electric dipole-photon antennae due to negative-positive charge or D and R respectively, and the tyrosine=Y is the photon antennae. This universal switch works on every membrane, in immune system, in many hormones. 
Official NIH Covid-19 sequence has 3 of those complete motifs and countless other D/E-R pairs on its own! ALL charged amino acids will be affected by EMF fields, its basics of physics. The enzyme ACE2 to which covid-19 binds normally is bound to the Angiotensin II octapeptide DRVYIHPF, a version of super mini GPCR, which still has the preserved charge via which is affects the blood pressure, also in pregnant women...
So what binds to ACE2 both angiotensinII and covid-19 are GPCR's.. This 'D/ERY' motif in all GPCR proteins became so important that Brian Kobilka (Stanford) and Robert Lefkowitz (Duke) got Nobel prize for it.  Thus a rapid voltage gating of ALL GPCR's will apply to covid-19 of course  too.
 ""A voltage sparks a GPCR"" by Peter Stanfield,  implies that the rapid voltage gating must equally apply to parts of covid-19, and thus connects it with EMF effects on a charge flow through cellular membranes.
Another paper ""Angiotensin and biased analogs induce structurally distinct active conformations within a GPCR"" written by no other than R.Lefkovitz and a little man A.C.Kruse is equally important, since it appears that ONE SINGLE AMINO acid change in the Angiotensin II octapeptide turns that entire electrical molecular switch into a new version, affecting the entire beta-arresting cascade involved in infectious processes!!!
No wonder, that our Nobel prize winner Dr. Lefkowitz now writes a next article: ""Œ≤-Arrestin-Biased Angiotensin II Receptor Agonists for COVID-19 "". Dr. A.C. Kruse synthesized in the meantime a lot of active GPCR state‚Äìstabilizing synthetic nanobodies with the result in a PNAS article: ""Synthetic nanobodies as angiotensin receptor blockers"", which will affect future blood pressure but also, quote: ""Engineered ‚ÄòNanobodies‚Äô Block SARS-CoV-2 from Infecting Human Cells""... Synthetic solution to a 'natural virus'?? Who pays for it?? Dr. A.C. Kruse works in Blavatnic Institute at Harvard, yes, the same school which took so much money for research from Epstein. Blavatnik Institute finances come from the 4th richest UK citizen, Sir Leonard Blavatnik, a Ukrainian businessman, investor and also the very same person which is on the list of 300 ruling this world. 
Thus Dr. Kruse, educated in Stanford, the little man, produces the synthetic new human parts for the real goal of the top 300: global covid-19 solution.  Blavatnic Insitute has another celebrity, Dr. G. Church, the one who said, the next human will have DNA mutations within a week, with their
Iphones and related 'technologies'**, and that's the creme de la creme of geneticists, who have the plan to redo the entire nature, from scratch, so that it will never die.... Every single patent from Dr. Church* belongs also to NIH (US government) via grant money received, thus it is hard to distinguish what russia (Blavatnik) and what the american taxpayers are paying for in this entire research. One is sure, the knowledge about 
gene expression, and thus viral 'infections' influenced by Iphones is REAL! 
Who sits on the board of that Institute? William Jefferson Clinton, another top 300 member (yes, the president who is guilty of crimes on the american people for forcing GMO's on this entire world) sits on the international advisory board of the Blavatnik School of Government in Oxford, another little Blavatnik Kingdom, right next to the Queen.. Is it a wonder that suddenly the next top official on this planet, with the strongest military among any other country, now also gets, similar to Johnson, a 'positive covid test'??? THE criminality related to the entire covid story is growing exponentially, and it ruins lives, via patented, toxic, LETHAL DRUGS!!! Father, please forgive them, since they do not know what they are doing.

I could be mistaken let's talk like humans don't fkin roast me
Americans please enlighten me


Edit: trump in his golf course? While people are dying? Is he that ignorant?
Is there that trumps medical plan is realising?
But Biden is not wrong about the covid crisis though... The country has to cure from covid before the economy should wake up... But everthing need balance
Biden is like a newscaster üòÇ
Biden called blacks superpredators? When did this happen?
Closing to the end... It seems like trump is not doing much to stop white supremacist groups
What bullshit... If anything... America would probably be the last country to turn to alternative energy compared to other countries.... You guys literally rely on coal for electricity right? 

Biden could have been great... But don't get me wrong trump is much more convincing

Coal-fired plant is a means of energy production, take Colstrip, MT.  They have an over 1.2GW power plant there supplying back-up power to all areas of the pacific west to mid-west.  Yes, it emits lots of pollution but if the demand spikes and ‚Äúrenewable energy‚Äù can‚Äôt meet the demand the plant fires up to meet Americans insatiable need for energy.

Then there‚Äôs natural gas as a means for energy production... but oil is either processed or not but wouldn‚Äôt be used as a blasting material for energy production.  Yes, certain oils are used to heat furnaces in refineries but once again you get into supply and demand and Americans...  it‚Äôs complicated stuff üá∫üá∏",2020-10-05T08:29:57Z

You can't blame Greens, Transhumanists, Marxists, Socialists, Communists, Anarchists, or Libertarians.
They're not the ones in power.

Pro-BirthStriker Animal Rights Vegan Atheist Mathist PhD Mathematician.
Only maximizing fairness & justice & minimizing suffering matters.
MANDATE VASECTOMIES & MANDATE ABORTIONS & OUTLAW BREEDING until you make life perfectly fair.

I PROUDLY support Peta, Mercy for Animals, Extinction Rebellion, BirthStrike, climate activists, animal rights vegans,
Antifa fighting for LIBERTY for THOSE WHO EARN IT & DESERVE it and to MAXIMIZE JUSTICE/FAIRNESS
& to minimize suffering for those who deserve it.
Fuck religion, nationalism, culture, tradition, habit, the status quo. These are all just for entertainment.
Fairness, justice, minimizing suffering must always come first. Even above capitalism & communism.

To say a dog turd would be better than Trump or Biden would be an understatement.
Yes, we all know, the entire world knows, that ANYBODY would be better than Trump or Biden.
That ANYBODY or ANYTHING would be better than a republicunt or democrap.
But, there exists ZERO LOGICAL REASON to vote for just ANYBODY, to settle for just ANYBODY,
when you can vote for & put into office the TRULY GREAT: Greens & Transhumanists (and some other political parties).

1. Guns will be confiscated  
2. Police will be completely defunded  
3. 70% income tax  
4. All retirment, CDs, IRAs, etc.  will be taken and put into a slush fund
5. You will no longer be allowed to have single-family homes.  
     They will be taken from you and all inner city people will be moved in
      and you'll be on your own
6.  You will have to wear masks permanently
      (People have already been arrested for not wearing them outdoors outside of the 6ft range)

If you're not afraid of any of this, you should be.  These are all characteristics of communism.  Do the research and you'll find out information that I can't even say because I'm scared.",2020-10-05T03:42:44Z

2020-10-05T03:20:29Z,@nicodemusedwards6931,wW1lY5jFNcQ,"... there comes a time in every nations life, where it is stricken by crisis. Where we peer into the deepest void, touch the coldest stone, feel the hailstones and wind pelt our flesh till we‚Äôre bruised and bloody and beaten. It is easy to turn back, to try and return to a time we thought was simpler. In reality, the past was only simple due to our ignorance. It‚Äôs nothing but a lost vision. All we can do is move forward. If we don‚Äôt, we become lost in the void.

It is time for us as a nation to see if the American Experiment was a success. To see if the ideals fought and bled for are worthwhile ones, or just another system that crumbles like the rest. To all who would call themselves American, who look at those fifty stars and accept all our virtues and all of our sins... I ask you to do one thing.

Make the dream real. 

The dream of the immigrant sailing across the ocean for a better life. The dream of the slave wishing only to be seen as a person and not a tool. The dream of the soldier to come back to their loving spouse and children. The dream of the worker to live off their merit. The dream of the scholar to enlighten and improve through wisdom. The dream of the parent, to ensure their child lives a better life than their own. The dream of the child... to become something great.

Make the dream something we can wake up to.",2020-10-05T03:20:29Z

*Facts about the Hunter Biden Affair* 
Hunter Biden told his father that Ukraine's Prosecutor General (""state prosecutor"") was investigating a gas company (Burisma) that paid Hunter $140,000/month to be on the board. The state prosecutor had started to ask questions about why, and especially for what, some of the board members like Hunter Biden, received such large remunerations. In this context Joe Biden asked the Ukrainian incumbent leaders of that time to remove the state prosecutor from office whereupon they undertook a commitment to bring forward a proposal to that effect at the next meeting with the Ukrainian government.
But the state prosecutor, who was very experienced and known for his great integrity, had been called in from retirement by the Ukrainian government mainly to investigate potential grounds for corruption charges in connection with Burisma and the company's business partners. The government recognized that he had successfully handled several similar corruption cases before and decided that no action would be taken against him.
Therefore, Joe Biden returned to Ukraine to meet with government representatives to formally request, as Vice President of the United States, a swift dismissal of the state prosecutor. He stridently clarified that the $1 billion in financial and military aid appropriated by the US Congress (partly as loan guarantees) will be paid out only if the state prosecutor was fired immediately.
Wall Street Journal reports on Joe Biden's own description of how he made this demand abundantly clear to Ukraine and that he had the full backing of the President of the USA:

directed against all forms of provincialism, all insularities and

certain social assumptions and religious formulae have ceased to promote
 the welfare of the generality of mankind, if they no longer minister to
 the needs of a continually evolving humanity, let them be swept away 
and relegated to the limbo of obsolescent and forgotten doctrines. Why 
should these, in a world subject to the immutable law of change and 
decay, be exempt from the deterioration that must needs overtake every 
human institution? For legal standards, political and economic theories 
are solely designed to safeguard the interests of humanity as a whole,

Therefore, Mr JOE BIDEN is just a puppet in the 2020 election.

As 24 million babies killed because of abortion every year in China, 1 million in the US; are they worth of living?

Having to remove the Communist of China to end the danger for the world; coronavirus is the newest, clearest evidence. Mr. Joe Biden will take care of this actions? Who believes in him?

In 2016, US Citizens chose a non politicians over the politicians to lead the United States.  In 2020, US citizens will keep this decision to re-elect President Trump because of President Trump's achievements in the past 47 months, more than Mr. Biden achieved in his 47 political years.

‚ÄúIN Searching For A New Enemy To Unite Us, We Came Up With The Threat Of Global Warming‚Äù

‚ÄúThe common enemy of humanity is man.
In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up
with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming,
water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these
dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through
changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome.
The real enemy then, is humanity itself.‚Äú

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt the only hope for the planet that the
industrialized civilizations collapse?
Isn‚Äôt it our responsiblity to bring that about?‚Äù

Our army is the most powerful in the world, but under Obama as president, we fell under Iranian soldiers, our jobs in the US were transferred to China and there were many more humiliating issues to mention. under Obama and the Democrats in power. After only 3 years after President Trump and the Republican Party, our country becomes a mighty and great country that the whole world must respect. When traveling abroad holding an American passport we feel proud of our country. If the Democrats lead the United States, when buying a chicken, we have to bring a bag of money to buy the same socialist Venezuela. The Democrats of the United States wanted to bring the American people to the socialist line of slavery to China and let China control Joe Biden and the Democrats to bring the country down a steep slope.",2020-10-10T18:22:36Z

How many people is Donald Trump entities and subsidiaries employ let us say a conservative number of 50,000 and how much tax he pays for those employees furthermore how much tax those employees pay in City, State and Federal taxes and how much money do those employees pay for goods and services that are taxable. So please do the math it is better to employ thousands of people and the corporations employers to pay little or no taxes.
But those corporations also pay taxes for goods and services.
As far as the Coronavirus; there are 50 States that are controlled by the governors and many made decisions the caused the Coronavirus to spread.

No one ever talks about the turn-over. We lost so many jobs before Covid even hit. To be honest, Trump was saved by the Corona bell. No one's going to say anything about the loss of jobs in the following years because they can chalk it up to a pandemic. The turn-over rate was almost a third of that 700k. That's not a thriving economy; it's a stagnated one. If the trend continued, by the end of Trump's second term, at worst we wouldn't find a speck of that 700k manufacturing jobs. At best, somehow those jobs stay and we keep firing/losing and rehiring people at such an insane rate to keep all 700k jobs. Which one seems more likely?

If the Proud Boys actually punched an Antifa member in the face each like they suggested 4 years ago (which i supported and still do) the riots probably wouldn't have happened.
Because Antifa is fully of mentally unstable people, and when mentally unstable people are allowed to live with the rest of society, this is what happens, riots, arson, murder, etc.
The ONLY way to stop mentally unstable people that are allowed to run wild is to punch them in the face and show them their place.

Trump 20/20 isn't it funny how a man gives up everything he has and owns just to be persecuted and mocked and literally spit at kind of like Jesus when he was carrying the cross to be crucified because that's exactly what is happening to Trump he is being crucified for making our country the best it can be!,2020-10-06T18:19:38Z

It was was President Trump that Banned travel from Europe about a month later to limit the spread of the virus and he got called out again. Really? Meanwhile Nancy Pelosi was inviting people to CHINA Town in her home state of California as late as February 24th (when there were already 15 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the U.S.). This means this democrat would vote very day for Trump and twice on Tuesday, Nov. 3rd (just kidding to my fellow uninformed democrats that are actually voting for Sleepy Joe). Joe is For: Open Borders (and it was the Obama-BIDEN administration that created the so-called 'kennels' (really just fenced in areas) at the Southern Border NOT the Trump administration). Joe is For: Riots in our streets and that is what they are -- peaceful protests (like MLK) happened in the light of day NOT the cover of darkness - when arson, looting, & assault happens.

FROM 11/3/2020, to the ultra-left terrorist group Antifa and other groups
left-wing radicals from whom he has never demarcated and has never
criticized, then Biden is the candidate of the radical left in the USA not

Vermont widely admirer of Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution, admirer
and defender of Nicol√°s Maduro Moros the despot communist tyrant of Venezuela, behind
of Biden is also Mr. Barack Obama former president of the USA and a close friend of the
Cuban tyrant Ra√∫l Castro after his handshake and hug in Havana
Cuba on March 20, 2016, propitiated an expansion of relations with Cuba generating
more resources for the Cuban communists for nothing.

Why wasn't the modern Trader asking Joe Biden why he couldn't answer any questions directly. And then not allowing for discussion from AKA President Trump? It is said two minutes to answer the question and then up to 15 minutes to discuss anything left for the debate. But President Trump was not allowed to debate!!!

Biden's only job was to convincingly tell the story about his future presidency and the kind of leader he would be BUT he couldn't even do that. He miserably failed at one thing he was supposed to do -  tell us about his vision of America and how he would lead the country to prosperity in terms of economy, security, and health. Instead, the whole time Biden focused on Trump's failures, and what he tried to ""sell"" as his vision for America was so WEAK that I couldn't remember a single point from his speech. Whoever is advising Biden is an idiot. We know who Trump is - a narcissist, racist, he doesn't have empathy but people will vote for FAMILIAR and what they know - Trump versus someone who can't even articulate who he is as a leader and what he stands for.",2020-10-02T07:27:56Z

Many comments re: Trump interrupting. Just watch first 10 minutes. Moderator interrupted Trump first and then Biden interrupted Trump. Additionally, Chris changed the subject/topic everytime Trump was making a point, cutting him off, at least first 5 or 6 times. I stopped counting. During the second 2 minute (uninterrupted) time for Trump, Chris began arguing with Trump. Chris broke his own rules first and then blamed Trump for breaking them - shameful! They all broke rules! It was a horrible case of moderating! 

Biden called our current President ""a clown"", ""shut up"", ""shush"", ""a fool"" amongst others. That was embarrassing. Biden seemed to deny many things. He fluffed his way through and I honestly can't believe a word he says. I don't know... all politics seem so messed up. Sad situation.",2020-10-01T21:41:56Z

Not because Biden debated any better, just because how the debate went down. The debate itself is the best example for what's happening in this country right now, and what has happend during the last four years when Mr. Trump was president. We don't listen to each other anymore, we just offend the opposite without actually debating about the topic. The whole situation is getting out of hand. We need to unite during this hard time, not separating even more. Mr. Trump was supporting this polarization instead of holding the country together. We cannot let that happen for another 4 years. Mr. Biden isn't the best coice, but at least he is trying to unite us, while Mr. Trump's statements become more offending every day. Republican or Democrat, left or right, no matter what your opinions are, we have one thing in common: We want the best for the USA and that's coming together and talking about solutions like grown-ups.",2020-10-01T17:42:33Z

2020-10-01T11:14:39Z,@kansasross,K8Z9Kqhrh5c,"Trump is running a cult. Everyone is mystified why sane 
people will follow and support him. It is the mysterious 
psychological condition called Fanaticism. Once people 
are swept up by a cult leader, it is very difficult to bring
them back from what most of us call purblind madness.
Trump will not disavow the white supremacy groups
that wave his flag and vow to protect him. If Trump 
loses the election, especially by a small margin, he can 
call them to Washington and turn them loose with their
battle gear and machine guns. They will prevent anyone 
from trying to remove him while he takes his case to his 
hand-picked SCOTUS with his toady Bill Barr declaring 
the legitimacy of the Citizens' Armed Militia. 
  Who makes up a cult? Not only the and poor and out 
of work. He is their cult leader and his followers are so 
hypnotized by his lies that they will do anything for him. 
  They are exactly like the 912 cult members who drank 
poisoned Kool-Aid at the the direction of Jim Jones of 
Jonestown, and they knew it was poison when they 
drank it. Then they each found a little space in the dirt  
to lie down and die for him.
  In the case of cult leader Trump, they will fight to the 
death for him. Imagine the blood spilled in the Rose 
Garden, the Oval Office and the basement bunker.

This was not a debate, nor even an argument; by comparison, this was a verbal attack by the president to discredit the democratic party. I am an independent who has watched how the president has handled this country in crisis, and I don't see him as a good enough leader to stay president for four more years. Biden is hardly any better either, but at least he can stand up for his family in my eyes. Biden also answered more questions directly than Trump did as far as I am aware. I have no problem going back over this video again to double-check that, but the fact that this debate was undermined by the president when he promised to allow the other side to give their case uninterrupted; He hasn't. He never gave Biden even 30 seconds before he ""had"" to interrupt, and I mean that as an euphemism. How can we follow a leader who bends the rules and laws to his will when the people themselves hold all the power?",2020-10-01T05:42:15Z

Just to mine hundred tons of copper youd have to dig up billions of yards of gravel just to get to a copper vein in the earth leading to more destruction.  And on the topic of electric vehicles and especially tractor trailer trucks,  there is no electric motors that can haul 80,000 lbs for days strait , with critical loads that need to be on time within a couple days from one side of the USA to the other and only being able to go 100 miles a day nothing would ever be delivered in time, there would be more trucks on the road if they were electric because they would be much smaller and cost 10x more to ship rather than having 2 or 3 loads in 1 53ft trailer",2020-10-01T04:07:02Z

Trump is bringing it, Biden can't look at him, can't handle him, and THIS would be a president that would wish to be in power?

If he can't look at his immediate same country opposite, how the hell can he look in the faces of other countries opposites?

Biden still sounds likes he‚Äôs trying to make a ‚Äústatement‚Äù

This wasn‚Äôt a debate between them, it was a Biden ‚Äúspeech‚Äù

Biden just can't look at him

We're picking between a insane freak who didn't answer any of the questions Wallace asked, believes in conspiracy theories & dennounces anything that's against him, & is with white supremacy, & bigotry. & From the economy down, & killed over  200,000 by denouncing Covid. Vs Biden who answered all Wallace's questions look in the camera look into the camera and answered to in a hole to America. who seems to really care about Americans and know his ish from experience. he had answers to climate change, against white supremacy, building the economy, creating jobs, even while the president was shouting over him rapidly. Biden won by far. Trump was scared and tried to make Biden not answer by cutting him off or talking over him. I noticed most people who vote for Trump are insane, they believe in conspiracy theories & they watch all these Q Annon & crazy made-up stuff by the crazy radical Right. Listen U & I have Republican friends who WERE NORMAL, but since this presidency they have become CRAZY. Insanity is what's becoming redundant & rhetoric for the Republicans. Listen u all have different race of friends. I bet some of us are losing them on Facebook etc since Trump became president. Trump's a madman & so are his hardcore fans. Even in The end Trump refuse to handshake Wallaces  ‚úã hand,,  at least Biden tried but Wallace didn't reach out for Biden cause he's Fox 5.. and still Biden won this debate. to me there's a difference from right, & 'Racist Radical Right', Trumps retoric words/tweets has created. A radical right who believe in in racism, run over people when they just using words, & signs protesting etc. & Shootup people for being Hispanic in El Paso Texas. These areTrump's people. I know real good Republicans who hate Trump. Do u want more of this, do u want more separation & violence, more deaths on Covid, or do u want a calm cool wealthy economy.

Biden: Leaves the debate with a raging migraine, as he deeply contemplates how on earth he got elected in the first place. Despite the migraine, he leaves completely confident he‚Äôs showed America the lack of brains this guy has and thinks he has proven why he should be elected.

Now I am left-wing and I support Biden's proposals, esp on the economy and creating jobs. Also to try to bring back some kind of respect to the US on the world stage.  So who won? Trump by a mile -  he just blasted Biden so much he was very tired at the 57 min mark. Everything bar one  Biden did not want to answer a question directly he looked at the camera and appealed to the stupidity of American voters. That is not treating them with respect but disdain. Trump does not care about left-wing voters all he cares about his base and he was aggressive but as not aggressive as I thought he would be. He certainly nailed Biden on Russia, law, and order, etc. Biden nailed Trump on race and racism et al and the future economy. The media clearly want Biden to win and so do the American establishment, so in that sense, Trump is right about being victimized. Trump was dogged by Russia all through his presidency, so it is right to ask the next possible president to be asked the same. It was Biden who started the insults and Trump took it to a new low in one of his comebacks but he did not do it as much a Biden. Criticism is ok is but not as bad as Biden, though one would argue Trump was worse. It is certainly true that Trump really aimed hard at Biden and this wore him down.",2020-09-30T18:26:16Z

BLM protesters are campaigning for rights and for people to recognise and correct inequalities, yet he responds by bringing in force to stop the marches instead of listening to what they have to say. Large forest fires are caused due to global warming and his response is to clear the shredded trees that easily alight instead of questioning why they are shredded in the first place. He acts upon issues with short-term superficial solutions.",2020-09-30T17:27:12Z

Respect to the former office or not that's downright confusing. is it a trigger word to keep him in the right frame of mind? candidate biden would be the more suitable salutation in this situation.

So if the U.S. wants to change its life of relying on products made in China, the U.S. It is necessary to allow companies from Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea that produce products in China to voluntarily leave China to other countries to produce and ship to the United States, so as to change the trade deficit that China has earned a large amount of U.S. dollars from the United States in the past. Pay attention to the situation that American companies go to China to produce products because of the Chinese market. For example, the product technology manufactured by Tesla and Apple in China is the technology that China wants to obtain, because then China can use the power of the country to copy it, and then In the international market, in turn, it competes with American companies.

It is as though Biden had no defence except calling Trump a liar, explicitly and implicitly. He brought up absolutely no examples where his policies, over forty+ years, have improved any single minorities lives let alone America as a whole.

Trump had multiple examples of how his policies have improved others lives. He has taken on the 'big pharm's' to reduce drug prices; this is a matter of fact. He attacked Biden's family about the Ukraine/Russia/China growing scandal and Biden also refused to answer the question about unconstitutionally getting rid of the filibuster and stacking the courts.

Trump would be far better served if he 'played the game' and got the moderator on side; he missed a lot of opportunities through frustration and a lack of control.

What a mess! No statements at all about the future intentions of the Democrats leaving the accusations of Biden being a socialist Trojan horse standing.

When it comes to the issue of Health Care, that affordable health care is very expensive. It was the democrats that put the ban on our ability to fill our prescriptions in Canada, where the medication is much more affordable. I should not have to pay a tax penalty, because I can't afford the 600 bucks a month for the Affordable Health Care...So I agree with Trump concerning the cost of Obama Care. I also agree with Trump pertaining to Biden (Clintons) labeling our Black Men as Super Predators and setting the tone for more police killings and unjust prison sentences for Black men....Both candidates are bad for Minorities.

He spent most of his time throwing snide comments instead of speaking to any of the questions or issues.  Constantly interrupting and not listening and lacked grace.  He is in no way even capable of the job and it was clear that will not change if the American people vote this man in again.

His collusion with Chinese Communist Party is a more serious national security issue than his collusion with Russia and Ukraine, because of China‚Äôs dream for the world supremacy.

Why could BHR (his son‚Äôs business) receive billions of dollars from China two weeks after Vice President¬†Biden at that time and his son‚Äôs visit to China by Air Force 2 in 2013?

BHR used that money to invest in CGN and AVIC (Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs companies), which are said to have been founded to spy on US technology and F-35. ¬†¬†¬†In fact CGN was later charged with stealing nuclear technology and punished under the President Trump administration. ¬† ¬†Nevertheless, BHR still seems to hold share in CGN!

Why did the Obama.Biden administration tolerate China‚Äôs sudden declaration of ¬†occupation of the South China Sea? ¬† Why could the Chinese naval power overtake ours to be #1 in the world during the Obama/Biden time?¬† Why cannot Obama fully support Biden in the presidential election? ¬†¬†Because of Biden‚Äôs deeply collusion with China?
