    to Cyrus, whose right hand I take hold of
to subdue nations before him
    and to strip kings of their armor,
to open doors before him
    so that gates will not be shut:
2 I will go before you
    and will level the mountains[a];
I will break down gates of bronze
    and cut through bars of iron.
3 I will give you hidden treasures,
    riches stored in secret places,
so that you may know that I am the Lord,
    the God of Israel, who summons you by name.
Then it says this:
I summon you by name
    and bestow on you a title of honor.

The USA has been terrorized by Obama's bad dream ideas for America ever since he took office. I can only pray we can fix all the damages he has caused. We need to protect our country & citizens better and start up holding the laws that our current government has not been enforcing under Obama. We need more jobs & more affordable housing. We need affordable education and lower taxes.  A lowering of company industry regulation would also encourage and bring companies back to America again. This would also help our oil, gas, steel, lead, & coal industries. One thing for sure we do not need people who wish to destroy our constitutional rights to own firearms.

The truth is that if you take the time to read those religious bestsellers you realise that the message is similar, 
they make the apology of hatred and both dare to say that you shouldn't kill while telling you to kill, 
either the Jews for a book or the person who works on the sunday for the other. 
One is Hitler, the other is just dumb. Both are wrong and deliver no message of peace what so ever. 

Religion caused every war in this world and if you need to count how many deaths happened due to a religion or another to assert that one religion is better than another the cult of the giant invisible pink unicorn never caused any death. 

I am Atheist, I refuse to being associated with an ideology that can't be proven neither right nor wrong but rather prefer to admit that I cannot possibly know if a god exists and I do not care if they do exist or not. 
What I do know for a fact, however, is that those religious books, depict the same inhuman behaviors against people not believing in them. 

How can I do that, you ask ?
Simple enough, I took the time to read their book. 
And what I saw is beyond belief and can only be depicted by the words ""Unfounded hatred"".

1532,"random canadian reporting in here. i just want to say to anyone from trump's campaign that may read this. you need to emphasize (reference to starting around speech 51:00), you need to emphasize putting money into the lower/middle class pockets. you need to speak to these people directly and say that you will instill fair trade laws that will positively affect their daily lives by requiring money goes to them rather than concentrating to corporations which do not spread wealth back to usa citizens. i believe if you do this and truly seek this, the lower/middle class will improve.

when we outsource to other countries, a benefit of free market capitalism, we maxmize net profit to corporations, but they do not spread the wealth back to usa. they hold onto it and invest it into making more money, but there is no focus on usa citizens and increasing their wealth. that is not the way to stimulate national economy (that is focus on global economy). that is how you benefit the elite. if we required that corporations build locally and force them to make less profit, they will find ways to increase net profit in this model, and we will see more wealth spread back to citizens.

you need to appeal to the logic that free market capitalism eventually leads to one master corporation that holds all the wealth. if they do not pay divend cheques to citizens, where does all this money they make go? its not possible for it to increase wealth of usa citizens if the citizens are not able to spend more money in the same economy. sure chinese welded metal results in a cheaper product, but how can citizens afford that if the money savings dont go back to them? there are many problems here and trump is ALMOST appealing to this notion, but he is missing the critical focus and emphasis on putting the money into usa citizens. he is appealing to this, but he needs to better highlight why the corporations are concentrating wealth but not spreading it back. you have to make the citizens aware of why concentrating wealth to corporations does not help individual citizens except for the 1% that have access to the concentrated wealth.

I also wonder ""if"" all of the jobs created by Donald Trump is on ""American soil"" or does he OUT SOURCE? 

If he is utilizing out sourcing wouldn't he be taking JOBS away from ""American"" citizens by allowing foreigners to fill the positions abroad?

Doesn't Donald Trump own buildings in other countries, other than America? When he built those buildings did he ""SEND"" Americans over there to construct those buildings? If he didn't, isn't that taking JOBS away from American laborers/workers?

How far do ""EVERYTHING AMERICAN"" go with Donald Trump?

Is it a possibilty that TRUMP just want to see his name on another building-preferrably in the WHITE HOUSE. 

Does he want to be PRESIDENT because a part of him would like to see the TRUMP name in the history books? 

He does appear to love BRANDING! He loves his ""name"" in lights, on buildings, etc.

In his defense...everybody love to see things ""personalized"" with their name, but I wonder if this obssession with ""his"" name on everything.. is some type of VANITY issue?

Why is it that when Donald Trump goes out to deliver a speech... fights brake out?

1771,"Trump will not unite the nation.., in fact he will divide it as it has never been divided before.

Look closely at his speech, and you will see that Trump's actions mimic those of Hitler, during his early days on his run for power.

Law and Order, were the words used by Hitler, Mussolini, and Richard Nixon. And we all know what the world was like, with those three men. 

Nixon's ""War on Drugs"", followed by the same action by Reagan, has left our prisons and jails full of drug users, not drug dealers. And for every drug dealer that is jailed or imprisoned, two to three new ones take its place.  Pablo Escobar, was followed by dozens of drug lord/dealer, with the recent being El Chapo. And others are still waiting in the wings.

We all know that the ""hard/heavy hand"" method of defeating drugs and its dealers is not working. We are only leaving hundreds dead bodies in the streets around the world. There is a better a method, like the one used in Portugal or Holland.

Those methods do not stop drug use, but it does reduce the use of drugs and reduce the number of people going to prison, and it reduces the body count. Saving the public billions of dollars.

The Republican War on Hillary Clinton, is wrong.

Yes Clinton voted for the war in Iraq, as did nearly every Republican. So because she acted in a bi-partisan way, that does not makes her unfit to lead.

Yes Clinton was the US Sec. of State, yet  U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, was the overall ""commander on the ground"". He knew the mission and the problems that came with the mission. He knew first hand the dangers and was advised about those dangers and the lack of safety of himself, his people, and the mission while in Libya. 

Clinton was 5700 miles away, if he had called her and informed her of the dangers, she would have acted on his recommendations. But he did not. As the commander on the ground, it was his responsibility, to access the mission, it completion, and the overall safety of his people and himself. Calling Clinton or anyone else, at the time the shooting had started,  was not going to produce the results that everyone wanted and hoped for.

A rescue mission with hundreds of military men, could have failed. No one knew the sizes of the forces that was involved. There was no good intelligence to rely on.

Libya had gone through a ""civil war"", and millions of people were armed with a lot of fire power. And our military would not know who was friend or who was foe. It could have ended badly, than the lost of four Americans. It could have been worse.

Monica Samille Lewinsky:

Clinton loved her husband. And like all men, we do have our faults.

Hillary Clinton viewed Monica Lewinsky as her friend. She eat with her, talked to her, viewed her as a close and kind person, that she held in a very high regard. But Monica Lewinsky betrayed her. Because if Bill Clinton was becoming a problem, Lewinsky could have went to Hillary or anyone within that circle and told Hillary of the problem. And she could have put a stop to it.  

Lewinsky, like the others, could have told those that they knew, and word could have gotten back to Hillary, so that she could stop that action cold. But they failed her. 

So Hillary did what she knew was best. Protect her man, family, child, and marriage. 

She had to decide, if those actions were political actions, to trap the president, since all men have a weakest for beautiful women. And that it could be a setup of any type.

So Hillary defended the home front. 

To me, that says a lot about Hillary. She is loyal, dependable, and have a code of honor that is rock solid.

Trump cheated on most of his wives. He is not loyal, nor dependable. So watch your step with Trump.

Oh yes, Email. She was smart. So many foreign nations attacks government servers. Just look at Snowden. Even our own, goes for the government servers, that's were the secrets are. Trying to find an IP address in the commercial and private sector, is a bitch. There are 10 to 17.2 billion IP addresses, compared to 140 million government email servers, with 514 million IP addresses. Government servers are easy to find, and hacking them is even easier. Because they all use similar encryption methods, and they all have super computers, that can break down the codes in days or months.

plots and dark doings to scare the quivering masses. And no one on the 
public stage is better at the Big Lie this year than Trump. PolitiFact 
found that 75 percent of his so-called factual statements are “mostly or entirely false.” The other 25 percent were “half true” or “mostly true.” His score in the flat-out “true” column was zero.
But that doesn’t stop him. The more lies he tells, the more popular he is 
with a large part of the Republican base that lives in a world of 
made-up horror and blunt force solutions.
So, hordes of Mexicans continue to rush into the United States, he says, 
when in fact more people are now returning to Mexico than are coming in.
 Syrian refugees are “pouring into the country” when barely 2,000 have 
been admitted. And Trump continues to say “I saw” thousands and 
thousands of Muslims in New Jersey cheering the collapse of the twin 
towers on 9/11, when no such thing has ever been documented. The goal is
 to get you to hate them — Mexicans, Muslims, the object of all your fears.

become president, we’re all going to be saying Merry Christmas again, 
that I can tell you.” With Trump, the seasonal salutation may be

Shame on ALIPAC for endorsing this man instead of the sole candidate (Cruz) who has been tried and found true on opposition to amnesty.

Trump is the shiny object who (like most politicians) tells people what they want to hear. But if you pay close attention, you can get hints of what is coming once he gets his way.

Schwartz can understand why Trump feels stung, but he felt that he had

it personally. People are dispensable and disposable in Trump’s world.”

2081,"The woman whose case was used in the Roe vs Wade, is now stounchly pro-life. There are countless other women who bought into the hype that children in the womb aren't worthy of human rights, who later change their minds. The attitude that ""a woman-should-be-able-to-do-what-she- wants-with- her-own-body, leads to faulty thinking that the babe in her womb is part of the mother's body. Who doesn't know that a mother's DNA can never be the same as her offsprings, or anyone elses, unless that individual her identical sibling?  Then who does live in their mom's body; has their own unique human DNA; and is living and growing according to the pattern in which all people grow, and is, of course, a separate person? Geeze: that's a no-brainer: her child, of course!. Do pro-choicers forget that ""All people be CREATED free and equal?""  If we have our own unique human DNA from conception until our deaths, how can we be anything other than humans? . So why shouldn't all babies in the womb have full human rights? Referring to the youngest amoung us as ""embryos and fetuses"" is merely a way to muddle the thinking in some. But these are simply stages of human development: stages which continue after birth from newborns, toddlers, etc. all the way to and including the olders amongst us, the centurians.. 
   What is so special about being born that would make such a difference that those who have not yet been born, should not have the rights afforded to all other people? After all, babies continue to be the same person in and out of the womb.. Why is an identical twin who has been born afforded full human rights; while the identical twin in the womb... according to Hilary... should have no human rights; that the government should allow an abortionest to turn the living baby around and crush his skull so he pull the child out dead, and without being  charged with child abuse and murder? Why shoudn't the government protect the most powerless and vulnerable amough us: our own unborn children? Who could believe that some living people have bodies with 4 legs and arms and eyes; two or more hearts and heads,, etc.? Only pro-choicers, of course  : \
  If Hilary were really for women and children, she'd be supportive of promoting mothers' maternal instincts to protect and love all her children: both in and out of the womb.  Perhaps what Hilary really wants is to promote only healthy, ""normal"" kids; and kill off defenseless handicapped babies in the womb, while it's still legal to do so. But handicapped people should have all the same human rights that everyone else does. To think otherwise, I believe, is Hitleresque.",2016-11-03 02:43:44+00:00,-0.8066,Negative,2016-11

want to accept tens of thousands of Syrian refugees in the very near 
future.  They claim refuges will only be allowed into the country after 
being ""vetted"" meaning they will have undergone an extensive background 
investigation.  Don't be fooled by this rhetoric. Below is only 
one example of the many Afghans who have served, shoulder to shoulder, 
with our fighting men and women, proven their loyalty, and have put their, and their families lives in jeopardy assisting our troops on the battlefields in Afghanistan. 
 I have written several  Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) letters for 
Afghans I know and trust who have assisted me with my efforts in 
Afghanistan and I have seen their frustration as the ""vetting"" process 
slowly progresses.  Currently, the average wait time for an Afghan 
Interpreter to receive their visa is approximately 3 years. How 
then, if it takes up to 3 years to properly vet  Afghans who have proven
 their loyalty serving with our troops, is it possible to process tens 
of thousands of refugees, who have little to no traceable background in 
such a short amount of time?

2096,"Our country's greatness has come and has been seen the prosperities from America's own foundations and constitutions as the facts and principles.  This is why I believe our country's Gov't servants should only lead and govern by America's own foundations and constitutions as the principles and loyalty to America and America's own foundations and constitutions instead of by own wills, or willingness, or favorite of believes, or ideas from influences from other systems, or countries, but by America's own foundations and constitutions for America's own patriotism and loyalty.  Because we are America and should lead by America's own foundations and constitutions only.  Our judicial systems of the Supreme Court should only divide the wrong from the right by our country's own constitutions not by anything else, including the partisanship, powers, ideologies, fantacies, favorites, own recognitions...etc., but to divide by America's own patriotism and loyalty as the principles from the only standard of America's own rules of the laws of constitutions.  Because this is America of America's own foundations and constitutions only, not anything else.  This is why I believe President Reagan, President Bush 41 and President Bush 43 were all lead and governed by America's own foundations and constitutions as well as America's own patriotism and loyalty as the principles.  This is also why I fully supported Gov.Bush before by his great leaderships experiences for America's own greatness until he was suspended by things have nothing to do with him at all times. 😠 Since I believe Gov.Bush will be more than qualified to be our next President for America's own greatness.  Now, we will vote for Mr.Trump, since he was nominated by GOP and I believe his views of the importance of the principles of America's own foundations and constitutions are absolutely important and necessarily.  I believe that the former 1st Lady Clinton's views of America's own constitutions should go by what she believes in is wrong, because our country's own constitutions are there to follow up with instead of following up or not by any individuals' hobbies, favorites, or willingness, but to follow up with only without the choice.  America's own constitutions is the only measurement to decide what should we do and how should we do for America's own foundations of America's own greatness.  It's our country's Gov't's duties to govern by America's own constitutions only.  This is why every new President must swear by the Bibles to maintain, protect and defend America's own foundations of the Capitalism systems of the liberty and entrepreneurships by America's own constitutions.  Because America's own foundations and constitutions for America's own greatness were never come easily, it came from many many heroic patriotic brave hearts like President Washington, Bush 41, Gen Mattis, Gen. Robert Gates, The defense Secretary Rumsfeld, Gen. Powell, Gen. Petraeus and many many, including our Founding Fathers' sacrefice by lives and deaths for America's own greatness and principles by sets of America's own foundations and constitutions for America's own greatness, patriotism and loyalty as the principles.    However, I believe we should  respect our 2nd Ammendment, but also I agree with the former 1st Lady Clinton that make sure guns are not exposed to young peoples under 18 years old, which will cause unnecessary deaths.  The most important thing is the guns are only there for patriotic Americans who love our country and following up with our own country's rules of the laws.",2016-10-20 20:58:55+00:00,0.9981,Positive,2016-10

The majority of the country (especially millennials according to Pew research) is terribly away from the Democrat's stance on late term abortion (which is that its ""ok""). Hillary's just lucky her opponent is trump. If it were any other republican, he/she would have wiped the floor with her on abortion, unlike trump's clown like arguments. Murder is never a right ""choice"", no matter how you spin it. A society is judged by how it protects its most vulnerable.

2115,"To answer the question of accepting the result of the election or not, I
 will say this: if the result represents people's genuine choice without
 being tainted in any way, people will accept it; if not, people will 
not accept it, why should I?

When Hillary called Donald Trump “puppet” during the final debate, Trump went directly into a cat-fight which is what Mr. Farage warned him not to get into. If I were Trump, I would have said: when the mainstream media intimidates people not reading Wikileads emails by themselves but quote “you are learning from US!”, who is whose puppet? 
After the debate, Hillary went around, chatted around, wearing her faking smile and the social-life-use-only exaggerated facial expressions which qualify her to be nothing further than an average PR for a private company, except the way she was standing on the stage: keeping her feet shoulder length apart, which was probably because of her health issue. 
I have commented on her saying “America is great because America is good” which literally makes not much sense even to many English speakers but she repeated not only in the second debate but also in the final debate. The only reason I can see she stuck in this mind was to target Trump’s slogan: “Make America Great Again”. With Obama’s endorsement, she has no choice but to deny the status quo of America and painted Obama’s legacy to “Great America”.
In the closing statement, she said “I need you” which seemed incomplete. Yes, Hillary does need your vote, no matter you are actually the 99% in her “basket of deplorable”, no matter she calls you N* word behind your back, she at least needs you for once! 
As a conclusion, I would like to quote a comment given by a Netizen, Culo Tetas y Panocha : ”Foreign countries used to look up to America. We now look down to America.” BTW, I will not be surprised if I am called puppet of China or whatever. - -律政混混， IForYou, Tumblr blogger (English/Chinese), a voice for little people, ordinary people and minority people in Quebec, Canada!",2016-10-20 14:00:50+00:00,0.9249,Positive,2016-10

So, it is understandable if we expressed our fears about Mr. Trump's statements on immigration. America is values and she is strong with these values.

2519,"Why is Clinton trying to demonize the successful? They (Clinton types) want to fuel under achiever type's envious nature. This is all rooted in desire for excess federal government and more excuses to keep some useless bureaucracies. She mentions small business which is bogus, yea they want them small because in her dream world everyone works for a bureaucracy. She and Bill don't want to admit such a thing but the economic boom of the 90s was a direct result of Reagan's economic policies and taxes. It also helped Bill wasn't a complete radical like Obama and HRC. First you have to make it attractive for a business to operate here and just in case any of these dumbasses forget business is a ""for profit"" venture. So it makes sense to leave under such outrageous tax, and they're allowed to because they're private. This is what Trump in my opinion should stress, rather than bully a private enterprise into staying with penalties. We're walking a fine line of killing our Constitution. Yes there would be even more of a debt if they spent as much as they did under Obama admin with Trump's taxes but that won't happen. Obama is an incompetent man with selfish political ideologies that goes out of bounds (exec orders) beyond the will of the House. That is non neutral behavior as is Clinton. Let's not forget loopholes are *legal* because they're called deductions. Don't like it? change the law. I personally like a flat tax. Who needs IRS then, which has shown to be incredibly politicized via a crusty twat like Lerner. Some bureaucracies are needed in Federal level I concede, but it is way out of control. The States are meant to hold most of these tasks. Who really wants to work for a bureaucracy anyways and not provide a product or service that anyone really needs?

2609,"I watched this as objectively as I could. As far as I could tell Hillary lost the first 24 minutes. What she needs to make Trump and wealthy people like Trump answer is this: even if wealthy corporations are given tax breaks for not shipping jobs overseas, are those corporations going to pay American workers fair workers with benefits once given tax incentives? It won't matter if jobs are not being shipped overseas but those corporations don't create NEW JOBS! The tax breaks for the companies won't matter if American workers are not given full-time hours, fair pay, and benefits because the company owners are buying yachts, private jets, strippers, third vacation homes, etc.

But folks saying Clinton lost this debate either didn't watch all of it or if they did they didn't process his answers well. Trump blew this debate. You don't win debates by agreeing with your opponent several times, which he did when it seemed he didn't know what else to say. Or he made bizarre comments, ""Could be Russia, could be China, could be some 400 pound guy on his computer?"" WTH?

Two, in terms of the airports being nicer in China. China is not exactly a great model of economic development for America to follow. The airport is newer at the expense of China's poorer citizens. That's common sense.

Three, it's abhorrent that he won't release his tax returns when he can under audit!  It's abhorrent that he brags about not paying federal taxes when if anyone else did that, they're wages would be garnished.

He admits to stiffing his contractors - he's stiffed his lawyers! - and brags about it during this debate. ""They didn't do a good job."" Hundreds of people, Trump? Yet, he will bring jobs to America. He hasn't even paid the people that put up his drapes in his buildings!

""Frisk and search"" was deemed unconstitutional and mostly Hispanics and blacks were targeted. Period. There are bad people in the Hispanic and Black community out there, just like there are in any community, and those individuals should be locked up, but every Black person in the Black community doesn't deserve to be frisked and search at a cop's will.

Hillary spoke of criminal justice reform. All Trump barked about was backing up the cops. All Black and Hispanic neighborhoods are not cesspools of crime and not all Black and Hispanic neighborhoods are as tragic as Trump are making them sound. For him to state that, it's racist and it gives Black people who go to work, go to school, buy their groceries, and mind their business sound like fictional characters. 

Also, Trump insults Hispanics too often. You can't insult the largest ethnic group in this country - Hispanics - and count on them to vote for in November. Doesn't work like that. And his assertion, ""I think I developed a very, very good relationship with the African-American community"" is laughable. Blacks are the second biggest minority group in this country and all but the most stalwart Black Republicans will be voting for Hillary this November.

Personally, and after doing my fair share of research, watching the debates and learning about both their respective platforms throughout their political career until now, if you truly stop and put things in perspective for the sole benefit of our country's best interests, it is Mr. Sanders who best deserves and is without a doubt the most qualified, deserving candidate to represent the democratic party, crush elections, and become the next president of the US! Nonetheless, I also like Hillary and contemplated my standing, frankly, because she's a woman and I, like any other feminist, believe it would be great to see a qualified woman in a powerful and unprecedented position but as a US citizen, I also think its our main responsibility to support the candidate that will most efficiently serve our country and most importantly, make it a more viable place we can be proud of!  Not to mention, he's also a firm women's rights supporter! Bernie Sanders is the clear choice! So go on & vote for him comfortably everyone!!",2016-06-06 03:27:52+00:00,0.9927,Positive,2016-06
