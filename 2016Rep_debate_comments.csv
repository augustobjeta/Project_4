There are countless other women who bought into the hype that children in the womb aren't worthy of human rights, who later change their minds. The attitude that ""a woman-should-be-able-to-do-what-she- wants-with- her-own-body, leads to faulty thinking that the babe in her womb is part of the mother's body. Who doesn't know that a mother's DNA can never be the same as her offsprings, or anyone elses, unless that individual her identical sibling?  Then who does live in their mom's body; has their own unique human DNA; and is living and growing according to the pattern in which all people grow, and is, of course, a separate person? Geeze: that's a no-brainer: her child, of course!. Do pro-choicers forget that ""All people be CREATED free and equal?""  If we have our own unique human DNA from conception until our deaths, how can we be anything other than humans? . So why shouldn't all babies in the womb have full human rights? Referring to the youngest amoung us as ""embryos and fetuses"" is merely a way to muddle the thinking in some. But these are simply stages of human development: stages which continue after birth from newborns, toddlers, etc. all the way to and including the olders amongst us, the centurians.. 
   What is so special about being born that would make such a difference that those who have not yet been born, should not have the rights afforded to all other people? After all, babies continue to be the same person in and out of the womb.. Why is an identical twin who has been born afforded full human rights; while the identical twin in the womb... according to Hilary... should have no human rights; that the government should allow an abortionest to turn the living baby around and crush his skull so he pull the child out dead, and without being  charged with child abuse and murder? Why shoudn't the government protect the most powerless and vulnerable amough us: our own unborn children? Who could believe that some living people have bodies with 4 legs and arms and eyes; two or more hearts and heads,, etc.? Only pro-choicers, of course  : \
  If Hilary were really for women and children, she'd be supportive of promoting mothers' maternal instincts to protect and love all her children: both in and out of the womb.  Perhaps what Hilary really wants is to promote only healthy, ""normal"" kids; and kill off defenseless handicapped babies in the womb, while it's still legal to do so. But handicapped people should have all the same human rights that everyone else does. To think otherwise, I believe, is Hitleresque.",2016-11-03T03:31:19Z

want to accept tens of thousands of Syrian refugees in the very near 
future.  They claim refuges will only be allowed into the country after 
being ""vetted"" meaning they will have undergone an extensive background 
investigation.  Don't be fooled by this rhetoric. Below is only 
one example of the many Afghans who have served, shoulder to shoulder, 
with our fighting men and women, proven their loyalty, and have put their, and their families lives in jeopardy assisting our troops on the battlefields in Afghanistan. 
 I have written several  Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) letters for 
Afghans I know and trust who have assisted me with my efforts in 
Afghanistan and I have seen their frustration as the ""vetting"" process 
slowly progresses.  Currently, the average wait time for an Afghan 
Interpreter to receive their visa is approximately 3 years. How 
then, if it takes up to 3 years to properly vet  Afghans who have proven
 their loyalty serving with our troops, is it possible to process tens 
of thousands of refugees, who have little to no traceable background in 
such a short amount of time?

This is why I believe our country's Gov't servants should only lead and govern by America's own foundations and constitutions as the principles and loyalty to America and America's own foundations and constitutions instead of by own wills, or willingness, or favorite of believes, or ideas from influences from other systems, or countries, but by America's own foundations and constitutions for America's own patriotism and loyalty.  Because we are America and should lead by America's own foundations and constitutions only.  Our judicial systems of the Supreme Court should only divide the wrong from the right by our country's own constitutions not by anything else, including the partisanship, powers, ideologies, fantacies, favorites, own recognitions...etc., but to divide by America's own patriotism and loyalty as the principles from the only standard of America's own rules of the laws of constitutions.  Because this is America of America's own foundations and constitutions only, not anything else.  This is why I believe President Reagan, President Bush 41 and President Bush 43 were all lead and governed by America's own foundations and constitutions as well as America's own patriotism and loyalty as the principles.  This is also why I fully supported Gov.Bush before by his great leaderships experiences for America's own greatness until he was suspended by things have nothing to do with him at all times. üò† Since I believe Gov.Bush will be more than qualified to be our next President for America's own greatness.  Now, we will vote for Mr.Trump, since he was nominated by GOP and I believe his views of the importance of the principles of America's own foundations and constitutions are absolutely important and necessarily.  I believe that the former 1st Lady Clinton's views of America's own constitutions should go by what she believes in is wrong, because our country's own constitutions are there to follow up with instead of following up or not by any individuals' hobbies, favorites, or willingness, but to follow up with only without the choice.  America's own constitutions is the only measurement to decide what should we do and how should we do for America's own foundations of America's own greatness.  It's our country's Gov't's duties to govern by America's own constitutions only.  This is why every new President must swear by the Bibles to maintain, protect and defend America's own foundations of the Capitalism systems of the liberty and entrepreneurships by America's own constitutions.  Because America's own foundations and constitutions for America's own greatness were never come easily, it came from many many heroic patriotic brave hearts like President Washington, Bush 41, Gen Mattis, Gen. Robert Gates, The defense Secretary Rumsfeld, Gen. Powell, Gen. Petraeus and many many, including our Founding Fathers' sacrefice by lives and deaths for America's own greatness and principles by sets of America's own foundations and constitutions for America's own greatness, patriotism and loyalty as the principles.    However, I believe we should  respect our 2nd Ammendment, but also I agree with the former 1st Lady Clinton that make sure guns are not exposed to young peoples under 18 years old, which will cause unnecessary deaths.  The most important thing is the guns are only there for patriotic Americans who love our country and following up with our own country's rules of the laws.",2016-10-20T20:58:55Z

Hillary blamed half of Trump's supporters deplorables. Trump is not a racist, but he knows that you shouldn't surrender your country to all kinds of bad exceptions in the name of political correctness nor open borders like they are not even there. Trump doesn't ban for example solar energy. It is up to the people to buy some solar panels. The oil will run out anyway. And USA can't take the poor of the whole world in. The poor of the world increase by 80 million per year. If USA took 1 million and EU 1 million per year, it would become a mess, because you couldn't build infrastructure fast enough. Also if real jobs (not interpreting languages or other pseudojobs) keep going to cheaper countries, you end up with more illegals but less real jobs. That would lead to unemployement and restlessness, less security. Also some terrorists would infiltrate any refugees. But 78 million poor people per year wouldn't even be taken. The next year it would be 156 million people who was not taken. Even if you qvintuibled it and took 5 + 5 million to USA and EU, there would still be first 70 million and then 140 million the next year who was not taken in. And there are already almost 1000 million malnutritioned people and like 2000 million very poor people in the world. There are as poor as a poor in the Mexico or poorer total 5000 million in the world. If you bring these to richer countries, their consumption would go way higher, which would be bad for the climate. If everyone in the Earth consumed as much as an average American, you would need several planet Earths, but there is only this one. The right way would be to secure the borders and sell things like solar kettles and insect farming tech to places like Africa. There will be 4000 million people in Africa in the future. If like 1 billion people moved, it would be a disaster, and there would still be 3 billion people in Africa. There already are 1100 million people there, and a lot of the ""refugees"" are actually not real refugees, but people who look for better life. Some immigration to the west is ok, but you can't take all. Trump has planned for safe zones near problem areas, where people wait for vetting. Currently random people (real and fake refugees and terrorists etc.) just march into EU and wait for months to be vetted / decided if they can stay through asylum seeking process. Meanwhile the tax payers pay for their living, because they are using and some are abusing the asylum seeking system. This means also that European countries need to cut from the elderly and handicapped, because the asylum seeking system drains a lot of tax money. Also as majority of the incomers are strong young men, they tend to cause more trouble than if they were only kids under the age 10 or something. This trouble leads to former local people to get upset and they are protesting. In EU countries there have been protests almost every week for a year. The incomers also often do not want to get assimilated but they want to keep their culture.

 Regarding her emails, she has said millions of times that she never received nor sent any material that was marked classified. Yes she shouldn't  have used her personal email and she regrets using it  and i'm eager to see what FBI is doing now but keeping all these things aside and judging them on their policies, i believe hillary's policies are better than trump's.",2016-11-04T21:34:35Z

Abortion isn't a political issue. It's a human rights issue. Even bernie supporters and sensible ""progressives"" side more with the GOP position on abortion. ""social justice"" should start in the womb. The majority of the country (especially millennials according to Pew research) is terribly away from the Democrat's stance on late term abortion (which is that its ""ok""). Hillary's just lucky her opponent is trump. If it were any other republican, he/she would have wiped the floor with her on abortion, unlike trump's clown like arguments. Murder is never a right ""choice"", no matter how you spin it. A society is judged by how it protects its most vulnerable. Planned Parenthood donated $500 million to Democrats in 2012, this time they have Hillary in their pockets, Hillary's fine with late term abortions, cause she's just a puppet of the abortion industry.

2016-10-20T14:00:50Z,@nicecooper1236,cyx5e2c1SgU,"To answer the question of accepting the result of the election or not, I
 will say this: if the result represents people's genuine choice without
 being tainted in any way, people will accept it; if not, people will 
not accept it, why should I?

When Hillary called Donald Trump ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù during the final debate, Trump went directly into a cat-fight which is what Mr. Farage warned him not to get into. If I were Trump, I would have said: when the mainstream media intimidates people not reading Wikileads emails by themselves but quote ‚Äúyou are learning from US!‚Äù, who is whose puppet? 
After the debate, Hillary went around, chatted around, wearing her faking smile and the social-life-use-only exaggerated facial expressions which qualify her to be nothing further than an average PR for a private company, except the way she was standing on the stage: keeping her feet shoulder length apart, which was probably because of her health issue. 
I have commented on her saying ‚ÄúAmerica is great because America is good‚Äù which literally makes not much sense even to many English speakers but she repeated not only in the second debate but also in the final debate. The only reason I can see she stuck in this mind was to target Trump‚Äôs slogan: ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù. With Obama‚Äôs endorsement, she has no choice but to deny the status quo of America and painted Obama‚Äôs legacy to ‚ÄúGreat America‚Äù.
In the closing statement, she said ‚ÄúI need you‚Äù which seemed incomplete. Yes, Hillary does need your vote, no matter you are actually the 99% in her ‚Äúbasket of deplorable‚Äù, no matter she calls you N* word behind your back, she at least needs you for once! 
As a conclusion, I would like to quote a comment given by a Netizen, Culo Tetas y Panocha : ‚ÄùForeign countries used to look up to America. We now look down to America.‚Äù BTW, I will not be surprised if I am called puppet of China or whatever. - -ÂæãÊîøÊ∑∑Ê∑∑Ôºå IForYou, Tumblr blogger (English/Chinese), a voice for little people, ordinary people and minority people in Quebec, Canada!",2016-10-20T14:00:50Z

2016-10-20T23:00:46Z,@Nasigno378,cyx5e2c1SgU,"Do you realize combined all these massacres make up less than 1% of the overall homicide rate in America? The real major contribution to homicide in general is gang violence, the possibility to be engaged in an active shooter incident is fairly low for a massacre actually. As for your definition of ""mass shooting"" you are comparing incidents of which lets say Santa Monica, which made use of a KNIFE and CAR to say Aurora and Columbine, which made use of guns and various other improvised methods to assault people. 

I also laugh at how you did not include the Oklahoma Bombing which outright outweighed all these shootings alone and made use of nothing but a truck and fertilizer. That is a proof of how insignificant a means guns make for mass casualty with a single man with a truck can do more damage than MULTIPLE mass shooters.

Also, take in mind, your ""372 mass shootings"" are a fictitious number that somehow now equates a 2-3 person incident suddenly into a ""mass shooting"" when did 2-3 become ""mass"" how is that equating to 10-20 as compared to actual mass shootings? You know we have mass murderers that have killed more than mass shooters have in a year by themselves? WITHOUT A GUN EVEN.

""One person every 40 minutes"" that would be around 30,000 people. You could argue that if you included suicides but that is like saying ""Oh cause he didn't have a gun he wouldn't of killed himself"" Believe it or not, but a LARGE amount of people make use other methods to kill themselves, hell you can use Japan your Utopia as an example which has 5x the suicide rate than the US without any guns.

You want to know what makes a bearing on the homicide rate? Lapse of any actual law and order in this country. It is now a point you can PLEA BARGAIN to lesser charges, get out on probation for gun crimes, and be caught a week later after killing a kid in a drive-by. It is idiots that spend time rather than finally owning up to the fact society has people who ACTIVELY AND WILL CONTINUE TO BREAK THE LAW EXIST. No instead it is WHAT they USED and not WHAT they DID. That is the problem in America, and the media shows it as the point as you rather comment ""availability of guns"" rather than the ""mentality to want to kill many people""",2016-10-20T23:00:46Z

A mass shooting is an incident were 4 or more people are shot in the same instance.  What do you want,  what's your point? 

1 person shot dead every 40 minutes does not equate to 33,000, it equates to 13,000 people,  that's excluding ALL suicides. Where did you learn mathematics? 

1 person every 40 minutes = 35 people a day = 250 a week = 13,000 per annum.  Understand?

Tell me care to wager how well it'll work in comparison? We'd be spending a decade in just door-to-door raids to actually ATTEMPT to gain back over all 300 million guns. Why should -I- or anyone tell every officer we have to do this task because of a overly hyped fear of being shot in a mass shooting? 

We have 300 million people, and at most not even 1% has been a victim of a mass shooting. We have OVER 300 million firearms, of which not even 1000th a percent has actually been attributed to a crime. Even if all 2 million crimes recorded by the UCR had used a gun it STILL would not even be 1% of the total amount of guns in civilian hands.

You quote Abarham Lincoln on slavery but even in his OWN INAGURAL ADDRESS 

""I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so."""" 
-Abraham Lincoln, March 4, 1861

So before you open your mouth and put your foot in it, be sure to actually have some well FACTS in your statement. 

""We all need to drive 30?"" We have speed limits in excess of 70-80 MPH, or 112 to 130 kmh if you want the conversion. Need I explain how well over more people die to vehicle negligence each year than guns? Need I explain how DUI related incidents take MORE kids each year than any gun? So again, remove your foot from your mouth. 

I'll admit being wrong on the math but at least I did not attempt to quote a President who said the direct opposite. 

You like to keep quoting this ""worse than any developed nation"" But you fail to comprehend the fact each of your ""developed"" nations is roughly at most not even a FOURTH as big as the country you compare against. 

You also fail to comprehend that examples like the UK or any other that instituted gun control AFTER an incident had ALWAYS been a LOWER total before or after the new gun control.

You have no sizable example to put against America because you have NO nation that is anywhere in the same category to compare to. 

If you -really- think the guns is the issue then why if going by all estimates that a THIRD of the nation owns a firearm that we are not having MORE than that murder total? That 100 million people, and not even again a SINGLE PERCENT being a issue.",2016-10-21T01:00:20Z

A fetus cannot be classified as life, do you believe a fetus has the ability to understand it's own existence? To understand the consequences of death. No it does not, in fact it's consciousness is less developed then that of animals we happily murder and eat. It is not life and thus it's termination has no negative impact upon anyone.

Assisted suicide should be allowed for those suffering a terminal illness and pain who are in full control of their own mind,  of course. However,  capital punishment is wrong, as they know the consequences of death.

They can't survive on their own, they're completely dependent on others, they aren't terribly aware of themselves, they most definitely don't grasp the consequences of death (Do you remember when you were a month old?, how about two, three, four, five months, etc.? [I'll let you set the limit]).

Don't hope to get out of this with a fallacious  ad hominem attack.

Improve our foreign relationships and trade deals

Bring back Jobs

Take care of wounded soldiers

Improve the cost and availability of health care

Prevent criminals, drugs and illegal immigrants from entering the country

What is she going to do with taxes? Is she going to raise them for everybody or lower them?


I can answer all of these questions in regards to Trumps policies, now you do exactly the same. When I hear Clinton speak, all I hear is lingo and empty words. So you explain to me what her policies are and most importantly HOW she is going to do it.",2016-10-26T01:03:45Z

Hillary's touching story about Maria, raises a lot of questions.  Like, who is at fault, if her parents get deported?  They never even wanted to be Americans anyway. Do they feel bad about the millions of hard working Americans who paid taxes for those benefits?

2016-10-20T13:52:10Z,@nicecooper1236,dXWdiz--X0s,"When Hillary called Donald Trump ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù during the final debate, Trump went directly into a cat-fight which is what Mr. Farage warned him not to get into. If I were Trump, I would have said: when the mainstream media intimidates people not reading Wikileads emails by themselves but quote ‚Äúyou are learning from US!‚Äù, who is whose puppet? 
After the debate, Hillary went around, chatted around, wearing her faking smile and the social-life-use-only exaggerated facial expressions which qualify her to be nothing further than an average PR for a private company, except the way she was standing on the stage: keeping her feet shoulder length apart, which was probably because of her health issue. 
I have commented on her saying ‚ÄúAmerica is great because America is good‚Äù which literally makes not much sense even to many English speakers but she repeated not only in the second debate but also in the final debate. The only reason I can see she stuck in this mind was to target Trump‚Äôs slogan: ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù. With Obama‚Äôs endorsement, she has no choice but to deny the status quo of America and painted Obama‚Äôs legacy to ‚ÄúGreat America‚Äù.
In the closing statement, she said ‚ÄúI need you‚Äù which seemed incomplete. Yes, Hillary does need your vote, no matter you are actually the 99% in her ‚Äúbasket of deplorable‚Äù, no matter she calls you N* word behind your back, she at least needs you for once!

The Darfuri people, whether they are living in displacement camps or refugee camps should pray for a powerful, strong, wealthy America. America is our first hope, without ignoring or denying the help we have been recieving from other nations. Let me frankly disclose the fact that many families in Darfur, and certainly in other parts of the world, are recieving a lot of help from their famiy members working in nations such as America. sometimes this is only source of livilhood for many. So, it is understandable if we expressed our fears about Mr. Trump's statements on immigration. America is values and she is strong with these values.

People pick out and hear only what they want to hear, and don't hear what they don't want to.  So you saying ""Are you American?"" makes no sense what so ever seeing as you and the OP probably heard two entirely different debates.

I personally can not stand Clinton in any way shape or form, but at the same time the things that come out of Trumps mouth are like ""you do realize that politicians have to speak a certain way or things will be taken highly out of context, what you said may have been right may have been wrong, may have been a little of both , but the way it was heard was highly wrong"".

It's kind of like me speaking to my Mexican American co workers, they speak Mexican American English, while as my dialect is more along the lines of Canadian Irish British Aussy American US English... we can be speaking the same base language of English but what I say and what they hear doesn't translate sometimes, and what they say and what I hear doesn't translate sometimes. Just because you speak the same language in the same country doesn't mean you speak the same language, heck just the dialect differences between different parts of the country can make words mean entirely different things. For example when they ask me something I don't know and I responded ""I haven't a sodding scooby"" they haven't a sodding scooby what I just said, I used English words, they just aren't English words used the same way in US English compared to British English.

But that's neither here nor there,  point is people hear what they want to hear and don't what they don't, and that's everyone not just some people. So you probably heard an entirely different debated.",2016-10-20T07:28:09Z

You can however find tons of different articles who say the same. it is not biased unless proven otherwise. "" science 101"" :)...

I apologize for generalizing by calling you European. not my style indeed. however you are wrong about generalizing that in Europe is impossible to contribute. for most western European countries may be true, but every country has its own legislation. https://www.quora.com/Do-illegal-immigrants-pay-income-taxes.

With regards to being born in some countries entitles you to citizenship, you are actually wrong, in about 30 countries the ""jus soli"" method is applied, the US is one of those countries. in Europe is mostly ""jus sanguinis"", meaning obtaining it from the parents.

I agree that illegal immigrants are not good in general. However we cannot blame them all, we are not in their shoes. lawful aliens should be given a chance, my opinion.  does my citizenship matter?   all you need to know is I have legally lived in more than 3 countries in 3 continents. at home we have 3 different nationalities. I pay my taxes (more than 50% btw). we also speak three languages at home, and help those in need when we can.

2016-10-02T11:22:50Z,@dareptile9237,lIexQNGxwog,"Why is Clinton trying to demonize the successful? They (Clinton types) want to fuel under achiever type's envious nature. This is all rooted in desire for excess federal government and more excuses to keep some useless bureaucracies. She mentions small business which is bogus, yea they want them small because in her dream world everyone works for a bureaucracy. She and Bill don't want to admit such a thing but the economic boom of the 90s was a direct result of Reagan's economic policies and taxes. It also helped Bill wasn't a complete radical like Obama and HRC. First you have to make it attractive for a business to operate here and just in case any of these dumbasses forget business is a ""for profit"" venture. So it makes sense to leave under such outrageous tax, and they're allowed to because they're private. This is what Trump in my opinion should stress, rather than bully a private enterprise into staying with penalties. We're walking a fine line of killing our Constitution. Yes there would be even more of a debt if they spent as much as they did under Obama admin with Trump's taxes but that won't happen. Obama is an incompetent man with selfish political ideologies that goes out of bounds (exec orders) beyond the will of the House. That is non neutral behavior as is Clinton. Let's not forget loopholes are *legal* because they're called deductions. Don't like it? change the law. I personally like a flat tax. Who needs IRS then, which has shown to be incredibly politicized via a crusty twat like Lerner. Some bureaucracies are needed in Federal level I concede, but it is way out of control. The States are meant to hold most of these tasks. Who really wants to work for a bureaucracy anyways and not provide a product or service that anyone really needs? The big business she loves to hate are in her pockets and give the jobs whether she likes it or not. She wants to demonize them for that? Watch them leave and see what happens.",2016-10-02T11:22:50Z

This is no 'equal' bad option. Hillary is bad, but Trump is ABYSMALLY bad- you have all had enough time and exposure to him now to see this.

Something like the email scandal is nothing, and I mean nothing, compared to the greater issue: the sheer ineptitude and stupidity that is Trump. This is a legitimate concern. I wouldn't give a child a gun, who the hell thought it would be a good idea to give Trump a country.

All I see is a self centered individual who's priority is keeping save his interests in the near future and solidifying his power as an entrepreneur and the power of his  wealthy fellows.
The only concrete plan he talked about was to cut taxes to the already wealthy entrepreneurs and if that is a good plan.... well, I don't wanna know the rest.
I've heard like 20 times ""Law and order"" but he didn't elaborate any other plan of his.
Hillary is a lady and she is very elocuent and I would definitely vote for her. Unfortunately she also has a long history behind with ups and downs.

The collapse left millions of people's livelihoods in shreds, and, in this debate, Trump's 'presidential' response to profiteering from millions of US civilian tragedies: ""That's called business, by the way."" 

(30:00) Trump believes that because he pays no tax (yup, he pays NO tax), that makes him ""smart."" 

(34:10) He justifies not paying any tax by claiming his tax dollars would only ""be squandered"". 

(1:09:05) Trump believes that the USA should have taken all of Iraq's oil, ""I've been saying for a long time... we should have taken the oil."" This would have been seen as an act of imperialist aggression, against which the free world would have been forced to act. Yup, the world would either have invoked sanctions against, or declared war upon the USA.

2016-09-27T16:40:20Z,@4mydearlady,lIexQNGxwog,"I watched this as objectively as I could. As far as I could tell Hillary lost the first 24 minutes. What she needs to make Trump and wealthy people like Trump answer is this: even if wealthy corporations are given tax breaks for not shipping jobs overseas, are those corporations going to pay American workers fair workers with benefits once given tax incentives? It won't matter if jobs are not being shipped overseas but those corporations don't create NEW JOBS! The tax breaks for the companies won't matter if American workers are not given full-time hours, fair pay, and benefits because the company owners are buying yachts, private jets, strippers, third vacation homes, etc.

But folks saying Clinton lost this debate either didn't watch all of it or if they did they didn't process his answers well. Trump blew this debate. You don't win debates by agreeing with your opponent several times, which he did when it seemed he didn't know what else to say. Or he made bizarre comments, ""Could be Russia, could be China, could be some 400 pound guy on his computer?"" WTH?

Two, in terms of the airports being nicer in China. China is not exactly a great model of economic development for America to follow. The airport is newer at the expense of China's poorer citizens. That's common sense.

Three, it's abhorrent that he won't release his tax returns when he can under audit!  It's abhorrent that he brags about not paying federal taxes when if anyone else did that, they're wages would be garnished.

He admits to stiffing his contractors - he's stiffed his lawyers! - and brags about it during this debate. ""They didn't do a good job."" Hundreds of people, Trump? Yet, he will bring jobs to America. He hasn't even paid the people that put up his drapes in his buildings!

""Frisk and search"" was deemed unconstitutional and mostly Hispanics and blacks were targeted. Period. There are bad people in the Hispanic and Black community out there, just like there are in any community, and those individuals should be locked up, but every Black person in the Black community doesn't deserve to be frisked and search at a cop's will.

Hillary spoke of criminal justice reform. All Trump barked about was backing up the cops. All Black and Hispanic neighborhoods are not cesspools of crime and not all Black and Hispanic neighborhoods are as tragic as Trump are making them sound. For him to state that, it's racist and it gives Black people who go to work, go to school, buy their groceries, and mind their business sound like fictional characters. 

Also, Trump insults Hispanics too often. You can't insult the largest ethnic group in this country - Hispanics - and count on them to vote for in November. Doesn't work like that. And his assertion, ""I think I developed a very, very good relationship with the African-American community"" is laughable. Blacks are the second biggest minority group in this country and all but the most stalwart Black Republicans will be voting for Hillary this November. 

It is a mathematical certainty that Trump will lose the popular vote in November. His only shot may be the electoral college vote.",2016-09-27T20:31:00Z

I'm not sure that would happen. Many of our Allies, like Japan and South Korea, rely on us too heavily to leave. As with Britain, France, and Germanistan, they have their own problems to deal with. They'll soon find out that their mass immigration policies have bit them in the ass. If they want to ban the President of the most influential nation in the world, that's their choice.

And what I think about all 5 parts of the Republican Party Debate is that Rubio, Trump, and Cruz are squabbling with each other but the other candidate on the right just watches them and waits for his turn who doesn't budge in when the other candidates are trying to prove their point, but he describes his point very clearly just to see what the people think.

But overall Rubio and Cruz want to knock out Trump in the Debate while Trump proves his points against both of them just to satisfy the people in the crowd while the governor on the right just proves how and what he's going to do that is right to fully satisfy the people as well as other countries and their leaders.",2020-01-03T06:25:04Z

President Trump is NOT a politician (or as some say correctly, not a career politician), but a businessman with common sense who loves his country.  Career politicians HATE that. He can not be bribed or puppetted and manipulated.  The rest of the world is seeing his advantages over the entrenched corrupted alternatives. 
Love to President Trump, his family, inner circle and awesome policies. And the mighty USA.
Cheers from Australia

2016-03-06T10:49:16Z,@KrazyIndeed,Uaujjp3JKGY,"1:40 Megyn mentions Ted Cruz 'proposed' a bill. By 'proposed' she means WROTE. He then answers that he will, as president, repeal HIS OWN BILL!! If he can't write, nor repeal, his own bill in the much more powerful Senate, what is he going to do as President? Make more bad bills to repeal? He then tries to accuse Trump of hiring legal workers. 
NOTE: if you own a business, you know EXACTLY how many applicants you turn down for their ridiculous demands. If you are hiring for a position from 9am-12pm Saturday through Wednesday, they bitch that they can't work Sunday or Tuesday or Saturday at 10am-11am  for whatever bologna reason. If 300 applications were turned down and foreign workers were brought in then SHAME ON AMERICANS! They have no education and no skills then they make demands for a job when it is the employer that needs help in a certain position at a certain time.

Up is down, left is right.  Crime is crime. Nonviolent crime and marijuana should be handled less severe. Except for white collar crime.  Lack of punishment is detrimental to any society. Chicago has shown that.  A prosecutor who doesn‚Äôt prosecute. Crimes with no punishment.  No bonds required.  A free society comes with a greater freedom of choice. People are free to make bad choices and good ones.  Personal responsibility is missing from this debate. Fatherless homes.  What breaks my heart is seeing kids that never had a chance because they are often raised by a loving mother, by herself, who can‚Äôt do it all alone.  It starts with the home.  Very little focus on the home, the family unit. The actual statistics of those criminals and their background.  Often from broken homes. Single mothers with a variety of fathers who just don‚Äôt take responsibility. That is the crime. That is systemic.  You can have debates like this for another 100 years, and you‚Äôll be talking the same bunk.",2024-11-20T02:29:49Z

But not a peep about that.  Black on black violence is crazy high. Living in Chicago I see/hear it every weekend. Prosecutors who make excuses and won‚Äôt prosecute. Cashless bonds. A city where the politicians rather give money towards illegal immigrants than the black neighborhoods.  If you‚Äôre a citizen and homeless you can‚Äôt get a roof. If you came here illegally you get a hotel room.  Democrats policies are full of feel good that does wrong.  They want abortion but will use tax payer money to take care of people who came here illegally. 

Close the borders.  Find a path for some amnesty if the circumstances warrant. Criminals should be sent away.  Legal migrants should be applauded and revered, not systematically harassed with rules to become a citizen that are shredded by a political party trying to grow its base at the expense of our country.

The problem is that criminals often don‚Äôt care about gun laws.  Prosecutors don‚Äôt enforce them.  No stop and frisk.   The politics has gotten so out of wack, differing policies conflict with each other.  Personally, I don‚Äôt like guns, never owned one, probably never will despite living in Chicago.  But if I did want one, I should be able to get one with a background check.

Other countries who have less guns still have violence.  In the UK, knife violence is a king to guns. Slashing, murders etc. the % of violence is likely higher in the U.S. however regardless of the weapon.  The breakdown of the family, kids without dads, politicians who prefer victim politics than self sufficiency.

For a population of 320 million people we destroyed our economy forcing people into unemployment, people are losing their homes and renters are being evicted. For a Flu that has killed Confirmed a 157K deaths, thats a lot right? The average flu season that comes around every year has about a 1% fatality rate with 320 m. Thats mostly the very elderly and the very young, covid is barely a small fraction of that. Thanks ""news"" media for spreading fear and panic, for bashing our politicians who even attempt to say anything that resembles sanity, Your filthy greed has sent an already limping nation over the edge, we will be trying to recover from this economic disaster for a decade.

The Rich get richer and the poor get poorer. 

Just who are those ""baleouts"". The 1% who own our governement, that have more money than the rest of the 95% population combined in the US?

..A picture began circulating in November. It should be ""The Picture of the Year,"" or perhaps, ""Picture of the Decade."" It won't be. In fact, unless you obtained a copy of the U.S. paper which published it, you probably would never have seen it.

The picture is that of a 21-week-old unborn baby named Samuel Alexander Armas, who is being operated on by surgeon named Joseph Bruner. The baby was diagnosed with spina bifida and would not survive if removed from his mother's womb. Little Samuel's mother, Julie Armas, is an obstetrics nurse in Atlanta. She knew of Dr. Bruner's remarkable surgical procedure. Practicing at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, he performs these special operations while the baby is still in the womb.

During the procedure, the doctor removes the uterus via C-section and makes a small incision to operate on the baby. As Dr. Bruner completed the surgery on Samuel, the little guy reached his tiny, but fully developed hand through the incision and firmly grasped the surgeon's finger. Dr. Bruner was reported as saying that when his finger was grasped, it was the most emotional moment of his life, and that for an instant during the procedure he was just frozen, totally immobile.

The photograph captures this amazing event with perfect clarity. The editors titled the picture, ""Hand of Hope."" The text explaining the picture begins, ""The tiny hand of 21-week-old fetus Samuel Alexander Armas emerges from the mother's uterus to grasp the finger of Dr. Joseph Bruner as if thanking the doctor for the gift of life.""

Little Samuel's mother said they ""wept for days"" when they saw the picture. She said, ""The photo reminds us pregnancy isn't about disability or an illness, it's about a little person"" Samuel was born in perfect health, the operation 100 percent successful. Now see the actual picture, and it is awesome...incre dible....and hey, pass it on! The world needs to see this one!",2020-01-13T22:24:41Z

Nobody wants to go through 4 years of med school + 3-7 years of residency to make a mediocre amount of money. That is why doctors get paid so much. (on top of that only naturally smart and hardworking people can consider becoming doctors) The fact is that that is what is necessary for someone to become a good doctor and if the system were changed it would be destroyed. Another stat... almost all doctors say they would discourage their children from choosing the profession.

It does, in fact, give every single American representation, and protects us against what Ross refers to as ‚Äúthe tyranny of the majority‚Äù that usually occurs in direct democracies.

The United States is not a direct democracy: our country does not make legislative decisions based off what the majority of 318.9 million people want. America is a representative democracy, which means that we elect representatives to make decisions or laws on our behalf.

The reason our system works, especially when it comes to the electoral college, is quite simple: if we voted solely using the popular vote, voters in smaller states simply would not matter.  Census data confirms that half of the United States‚Äôs population is clustered in just 146 big counties out of over 3000 nationwide.  The other half of the population lives everywhere else‚Äìincluding 14 states that don‚Äôt have any of the biggest counties at all.",2017-12-31T07:43:43Z

Nobody wants to go through 4 years of med school + 3-7 years of residency to make a mediocre amount of money. That is why doctors get paid so much. (on top of that only naturally smart and hardworking people can consider becoming doctors) The fact is that that is what is necessary for someone to become a good doctor and if the system were changed it would be destroyed. Another stat... almost all doctors say they would discourage their children from choosing the profession.

2016-07-02T21:05:11Z,@mhambimusonda,ti2Nokoq1J4,"Lance Walker Here some reasons to vote for Hillary 112 reasons (and counting!) Hillary Clinton should be our next president,In 2016, we won‚Äôt just choose our next president. America will choose a direction for our country on issues from gun violence prevention to women‚Äôs rights to building an economy that helps the middle class get ahead‚Äîand stay ahead.

Hillary has proved she‚Äôs the candidate who can take on tough fights and get things done. But that‚Äôs not the only reason she should be our next president. Here are the first 112 reasons (and counting) that Hillary should be president.

What‚Äôs your reason? Add it at the end of this post or text #IMWITHHER to 47246.

As a former secretary of state, U.S. senator, first lady, and a lifelong advocate for women and families, no one is more qualified to be president than Hillary.
Hillary knows child care, equal pay, and paid leave are fundamental economic issues‚Äînot just ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs issues.‚Äù

Our democracy should work for everyone‚Äînot just the wealthy and well-connected.
Our next president could make multiple appointments to the Supreme Court.
We need comprehensive background checks on gun purchases.
She‚Äôll fight to overturn Citizens United to curb the outsized influence of big money in politics.
Because the wealthiest should pay their fair share in taxes.
We need comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to full and equal citizenship.
She‚Äôs set a big goal: More than half a billion solar panels installed across the country by the end of her first term.
She‚Äôs set another big goal: To generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America within 10 years of her taking office.
The economy is stronger when a Democrat is in the White House.
Hillary will defend Planned Parenthood and women‚Äôs health care from Republican attacks.

Hillary‚Äôs New College Compact would mean students would never have to borrow to pay for tuition to attend a four-year public college in their state‚Äîand the millions of Americans who have student debt can refinance.
Because taxpayers shouldn‚Äôt pay for millionaires‚Äô and billionaires‚Äô kids to go to college.
Guaranteed paid family leave.
She declared on the world stage that ‚Äúgay rights are human rights.‚Äù
Experts say Hillary‚Äôs plan to keep Wall Street accountable is the toughest of all Democratic candidates.
As first lady, she helped get health care coverage for 8 million American children.
Our veterans should have access to timely and high quality health care.
She‚Äôs the only Democrat with hedge-fund billionaires running ads against her‚Äîbecause they know her agenda is to stop their agenda.
After decades of fighting for progressive issues (and 11 straight hours of testimony in front of a Republican-led congressional committee), she‚Äôs proved nobody can stand up to Republicans better than she can. 
Hillary believes that raising middle-class incomes is the defining economic challenge of our time‚Äîand she has a plan to do just that.
Suspected terrorists, domestic abusers, other violent criminals, and the severely mentally ill shouldn‚Äôt be able to purchase a gun.
Because every 4-year-old in America should be able to go to a high-quality preschool in the next 10 years.
We need to invest in infrastructure and rebuild or expand our roads, bridges, rail, broadband, public transit, and water and energy infrastructure.
We need to protect Americans‚Äô right to vote‚Äînot billionaires‚Äô and corporations‚Äô right to buy elections.
Have you seen the Republican debates?

Hillary will work to keep families together and defend President Obama‚Äôs executive actions that protect DREAMers.
She has spent her life fighting for a fairer America.
She‚Äôs been fighting for women and children her entire career‚Äîever since she started working at the Children‚Äôs Defense Fund after law school.
She believes we need a new and comprehensive commitment to equity and opportunity for communities of color.
She‚Äôll empower veterans and strengthen our economy and communities by connecting their unique skills to the jobs of the future.
Prescription drugs still cost too much. Hillary has a plan to reduce the cost of prescription drugs.
As senator, she championed the Paycheck Fairness Act and co-sponsored the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to help close the wage gap so women earn equal pay.
Community college should be tuition-free for every American.
It's time to close the Charleston loophole that lets otherwise prohibited individuals buy a gun if their background check is not complete in three days.

Hillary negotiated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that ended the rain of rockets on Israel.
Smart power is a smart strategy.
We need a president who will crack down on companies that send profits overseas to avoid paying their fair share.
She‚Äôll defend Social Security and Medicare against Republican attacks.
We need a president with a plan to protect the transgender community from violence.
If Congress continues its refusal to act on comprehensive immigration reform, Hillary has a plan to act‚Äîand do everything possible under the law to protect families.

She knows how to find common ground to get the job done‚Äîbut also how to stand her ground.
Hillary is prepared to tackle all challenges, including national security‚Äîbecause presidents don‚Äôt get to choose which issues come to their desks.
She has a plan to reform mandatory minimum sentencing.
We need a small-business president.
Because every American citizen should be automatically registered to vote when they turn 18, unless they opt out. Hillary will get it done.

She‚Äôs a progressive‚Äîand she‚Äôs a progressive who gets things done.
Immigration enforcement must be humane and targeted‚Äîand she‚Äôll end family detention and close private detention centers.
Hillary has a plan to reduce the risk of future financial crises.
Because we should hold corporations and individuals on Wall Street accountable‚Äîand prosecute them when they break the law.
She‚Äôs one tough mother.

It‚Äôs time to end for-profit private prisons in America.
The Affordable Care Act is working‚Äîbut you could still use a lower co-pay and deductible.
Hillary will defend and fight to restore collective bargaining rights for workers.
She knows historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) serve an important public mission and will make a significant commitment to them.

Because it‚Äôs time to end conversion ""therapy"" for LGBT minors.
Hillary will put a stop to Republicans‚Äô systematic efforts to stop millions of people from voting.
We need a president who will fight to restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act after they were gutted by the Supreme Court.
Hillary helped negotiate the toughest sanctions Iran has ever faced.
She‚Äôs earned the wrath of the gun lobby, Iran, pharmaceutical companies, and special interests‚Äîand that should tell you something about who she‚Äôs fighting for.
She has a plan to invest in American manufacturing and revitalize communities that have lost manufacturing jobs.
She knows what‚Äôs going on in Laos.

She believes we should let families buy into the Affordable Care Act health care exchanges regardless of immigration status.
Prison is not a substitute for treatment for drug addiction and mental health issues‚ÄîHillary knows that and will do something about it.
We can create a new national standard of no fewer than 20 days of early in-person voting in every state.
Because those at the top are doing just fine. It‚Äôs your family who needs a fighter in the White House.

In the words of former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never met anyone more prepared to be president.‚Äù

She‚Äôll fight to end racial profiling in America.
She‚Äôll hold irresponsible gun dealers and manufacturers fully accountable if they endanger Americans‚Äîand that includes repealing the gun industry‚Äôs unique immunity protection.
She worked to expand the Family Medical Leave Act, allowing families of those wounded in service to their country to take leave in order to care for their loved ones.

Family members who care for ailing parents and grandparents could use some tax relief.
She has called out the Republicans‚Äô offensive, inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric because she knows it‚Äôs against our values as Americans‚Äîand our national security.

We should put American families over the gun lobby‚Äîand Hillary is not afraid to stand up to the NRA.

She‚Äôll ‚Äúban the box‚Äù so people who have a past conviction can get a fair shot at employment.
When Hillary was secretary of state, the U.S. extended antiretroviral therapy‚Äîwhich helps HIV/AIDS patients live longer, healthier lives‚Äîto 78 countries.
Businesses should be encouraged to train and hire apprentices.
The nation‚Äôs leading advocates for gun violence prevention have said Hillary‚Äôs plan is the right strategy.
Because women‚Äôs rights are human rights.
Because even when people didn‚Äôt want her to go to China and stand up for human rights at the 1995 U.N. Conference on Women in Beijing, she did it anyway.
Because a woman‚Äôs place is in the White House.

2016-07-02T21:21:30Z,@mhambimusonda,ti2Nokoq1J4,"Ten Reasons to Not Elect Donald Trump

1: The Man is a Jest

Donald Trump is not a serious political figure who commands respect. He‚Äôs a joke, a bad one at that, who hosts a television show and builds crappy hotels and ugly golf courses. He‚Äôs the punchline of the world, quite literally, as he was once the honorary punching bag of a celebrity roast. He has no shame and even less professionalism. Donald Trump as president makes the whole of America look like a joke.

2: His ‚ÄúValues‚Äù are Actually Bigoted

Many Republicans are seal-clapping in anticipation that a religious conservative will actually get to have his views forced upon America. For the rest of us, however, this is a scary prospect. Trump believes marriage to be between one man and one woman, which means he‚Äôs openly bigoted against the LGBT community and the rights of same-sex couples. Donald Trump as president sends America‚Äôs progress back 50 years!

3: He‚Äôs Not the Business Genius People Believe

‚ÄúBut Trump is a billionaire businessman,‚Äù people scream. True, but a couple of points here. (a) He inherited his wealth from a father who made a name for himself. (b) Most of his money today comes by way of his celebrity, not his business acumen. (c) He has filed bankruptcy multiple times, which means he‚Äôs make horrible decisions and has gone broke ‚Äì more than once. Can America afford bankruptcy?

4: He‚Äôs Too Cocky to Help America

Trump is so self assured that he makes Napoleon looks like he wasn‚Äôt entirely sure of himself. He‚Äôs far too self-important to ever be an effective politician, much less the POTUS. In foreign peace talks, the man would probably stand up and walk out, throwing a tantrum if people didn‚Äôt agree with him. And sorry, Donald, but you cannot fire the leaders of other nations! What will he do, besides whine like a toddler?

5: He‚Äôs Not Intelligent Enough

Trump did attend the Wharton School and went to Penn, so he‚Äôs not unlettered. However, when it comes to knowledge outside of business (which has still failed him more than once), he‚Äôs really painfully lacking. He knows nothing of science or mathematics and thus doesn‚Äôt lend any credence to stem cell research and other scientific advancements. With the way his mind works, he would simply re-inflate the housing bubble and hope that it held this time.

6: He‚Äôs Uninformed on Key Positions

The most glaring here would be that Trump was the ringleader of the Obama‚Äôs-not-a-citizen crazies. But he also seems to know next to nothing about how sanctions on nations work, evidenced by his screaming for ‚Äúmore sanctions‚Äù and ‚Äúmore sanctions,‚Äù without ever addressing any positives or negatives from these ‚Äúsanctions‚Äù whatsoever. He just likes saying the word, but he doesn‚Äôt know what it means.

7: He Has a Greedmonger‚Äôs Spirit

America has been making strides toward social justice and leveling an uneven playing field for nearly a decade now. Trump, with his ultra-capitalistic beliefs, threatens to rip away welfare monies and job programs and education funding in favor of more of a meme-style of American living; e.g. ‚Äúpull yourself up by the bootstraps.‚Äù Easier to do when one can afford bootstraps! Trump‚Äôs greedy spirit will cripple the poor.

8: He May In Fact Be a Racist

Not only has Trump said on Twitter that blacks and Latinos commit most crime in America, but he‚Äôs also on record saying that we should be giving Europeans access to America and a path to citizenship, but not Latinos south of our American/Mexican border. Why, Donald? Why does he seem to have disdain for racial minorities? We‚Äôre not saying he is a racist, but it smells, walks, quacks and swims like a duck. You do the math.

9: He Has a Shady Character

Donald Trump is not a man of high moral character. He recently left Scottish citizens homeless in order to build a golf course, bulldozing their lands and displacing proud residents of the nation. And he‚Äôs done the same to minority communities by destroying their areas for hotels and casinos. Plus he has spoken out repeatedly against affordable health care for American citizens who are poor. His morality meter‚Äôs needle is too low to read; his character is as shady as it gets.

10: He‚Äôs Far Too Impulsive

Trump is a man of more base desires and vainglorious pursuits. He‚Äôs been known to have Sean Penn-like outbursts, and the biggest part of his multiple bankruptcies was because of his impulsive behaviors leading to bad investments and overspending. An American President cannot afford to be so impulsive. A President needs to be measured and calculated and willing to compromise. These words do not exist in Trump‚Äôs vocabulary.

This list could have gone on for at least 50 solid reasons, but listed above are the top ten why Trump should never be America‚Äôs President. We cannot afford to have a guy like him in our highest office.",2016-07-02T21:21:30Z

Personally, and after doing my fair share of research, watching the debates and learning about both their respective platforms throughout their political career until now, if you truly stop and put things in perspective for the sole benefit of our country's best interests, it is Mr. Sanders who best deserves and is without a doubt the most qualified, deserving candidate to represent the democratic party, crush elections, and become the next president of the US! Nonetheless, I also like Hillary and contemplated my standing, frankly, because she's a woman and I, like any other feminist, believe it would be great to see a qualified woman in a powerful and unprecedented position but as a US citizen, I also think its our main responsibility to support the candidate that will most efficiently serve our country and most importantly, make it a more viable place we can be proud of!  Not to mention, he's also a firm women's rights supporter! Bernie Sanders is the clear choice! So go on & vote for him comfortably everyone!!",2016-06-06T03:27:52Z

I understand your concern for 'low-life' people eating benefits, and hey such people do actually exist in all countries.

Meanwhile, Secretary Clinton won 13.6% (18,335 votes). 86.1% is next-to-unheard of in politics. Now, Senator Sanders has never accepted money from the big end of town. First in Burlington and then in Congress, he has been representing his constituency for decades. Now, I do not live in the United States of America but, at least as I see it, you have to believe that: (a) people living in Burlington and the State of Vermont have, somehow, stopped being members of the human species; or (b) Senator Sanders is the one best able to represent people's interests.

People react like the heavens will fall from the skies and the whole country will collapse, while in fact it's just the opposite. it just means that everyone has a basic standard of living AS A HUMAN RIGHT. It means that you won't have to worry about going bankrupt when you fall ill or need surgery, because everyone has health 
insurance and medical and medicine costs are regulated to prevent price gauging. Everyone has a RIGHT to a roof above his or her head, so when you fall under a certain income threshold you will get financial support to pay for your rent (up to a certain threshold). Roads and bridges are continuously built and maintained by the government. If everyone has a right to get an education, regardless of his or her income, everybody gets a chance to contribute to society. So instead of being stuck to 
flipping burgers, he or she might actually become an architect, an entrepreneur, a doctor or even develop the next type of solar panel. This is in fact all VERY WELL possible, it only requires that everyone pays a bit more tax (those at the top quite a bit more or that they pay their tax AT ALL) and that we stop bailing out big banks with government (tax payer) money and that we hold corrupt and fraudulent bankers accountable for their misconduct.",2016-03-05T14:48:03Z

Growing up in Baltimore the Don't snitch ideology is greater than the protect the community. People such as this wouldn't know nor would care about the ROOTS of society and from where issues evolve. It isn't just about drugs though, it's also about the gap between the risks and reward. If someone sells drugs, they can rely on their friends to protect them and even strangers while they make much more money along with not having to lose their position of power. 

These people ignore completely the forces that drive these issues. On top of this they also mention guns, but realistically speaking you can obtain guns easily apparently from the deep web, and drugs of course are just as easy. In middle school there were people exchanging pills in Parkville MD whether the teacher turned his back or left the room. They were brazen enough to do it in between class exchanges. In highschool after we moved, there was a stairwell that people would do their drugs almost daily. Just recently my cousin was offered pills at the local Royal Farms. And to end look at the healthcare system with the obamacare. 

After it's implementation and to this day I get emails threatening me to get coverage. In PA I don't qualify, even unemployed there's nothing. at one point I was working 5 hours a week, barely making 25 a month after taxes. The lowest available and still available today is 200 dollars for the most basic (doctor visits with a 50 dollar co-pay) just to be informed that I'm basically screwed and will not be able to change anything. Currently I'm 28, I had been working since highschool and since Obamas administration (he isn't fully the issue but a big part of companies closing/ such low wages) I've had issue with work. This is also on top of having a 30 grand college debt after sticking it out and obtaining my associates. Keep in mind that I received a scholarship, and had been on the deans list for the final 2 semesters before graduating. 

Currently I'm trying to find a reason to go on since my degree is in criminal justice and I have nowhere to go with it. In PA they do not cover training programs, and there are no real jobs available in my area. (roughly 2 officers for the entire littlestown area and when I needed an officer we had to wait for a state police officer). So I ask what do I do with the debt and all the other issues beyond my control? Go back to a supermarket job that's minimum wage (also there are no public transportation so I'd have to get a vehicle, monthly insurance which is a few hundred, healthcare for the job, and on top of that make enough to cover student debt) So how do I move on? They mentioned loan forgiveness which was an empty promise and there was no job assistance for graduates. It was a long 6 months of no contact followed by constant calls from debt collectors. 

I also need to mention I moved up to PA from Maryland so from there I had been a recluse. Growing up with people who treated me like dirt thanks to my Spanish name (in spite of being raised by my American mother and being born / raised here with no hand outs just her alone working full time), I never had been social. And to this day I hate people / relying on them so I'm here to see what other think, how do I survive? How do I carry on without leeching off the government? Become a beggar? I can only live with my parents for so long after long since blowing all of my savings From my last job. There's a reason why I only leave the house when my aunt sends me money for holidays to buy canned food. My mother and step father can only tolerate me for so long before I'm another vagrant pan handling on the streets.",2016-03-05T09:30:14Z

I just feel she has a better grasp on the inner workings of the top level.  If nothing else first hand experience with diplomacy and security over seas.  I do appreciate the sentiment of Sanders with a socialist Democracy, however I don't see it as viable.  The economic engine shouldn't be hindered rather be reformed.  I just think that if Sanders gets into office, his grand schemes will hit a reality wall and he will spend his office struggling.  Clinton on the other hand knows the inner workings and will be able to achieve more. (BTW I'm a republican in the center, but Trump is making me reconsider all of that).  I will vote for Hillary over any of the republicans.  I will vote sanders over trump but that will be begrudgingly.",2016-03-04T02:13:48Z

Just to have the opportunity to choose him. At least he is (or says he is) worried about middle class, about healthy, about education. Not a ""I'm so amazing"" Trump. Neither a ""let's get back to the middle age"" Cruz. This dude seems really worried and compromised to make it better, to help people who need it.
I showed my dad a few videos of Sanders, know what he said? ""If we had any politic anything like this guy in here, I would vote for it""
Here we have right now in power the most corrupt politicians I've ever seen, they've steal so much and we going through a hard time just to make them pay for it's crimes. And we look around to the other politicians we could put in the power to make it better, but every option is worse than the last.

Hilary clinton seems to have the most typical response to each question.
1. acknowledge problem by using examples that are heartfelt
2. throw statistics at problem
3. vaguely outline what her plan is
4. summate about how we cant ignore it.
Also language like, 'we must try to', or 'we have to help *blank* to enable *blank* to help *blank*' is rather scattered and inconclusive.

yes hilary, we understand the questions are topical, can you please introduce information and opinion on your particular stance.

Martin O'malley had some opinions i aligned with, however i feel he is not strong enough of a candidate, in polls or calibre to win the later election or follow through with his opinions throughout the presidency. 

Based on this debate, i'd vote bernie,

How many people go see the doctor in a year? Once maybe twice? Yet you pay a monthly fee the rest of the time you don't go! So your not getting taxed but your still paying for it? So I ask why not have a tax where everyone doesn't have to worry about having a fat bill after seeing a doctor? It's like having earthquake insurance in the mid-west. It might happen but your still paying for something that ""might happen""? Well you say doctor would be flooded with patients? I don't know anyone that likes seeing the doctor, they rather go to work sick than miss out on the money they need to survive. Which gets others sick and the wheel keeps turning. I didn't have insurance last year, and was fined 600.00.¬†That is fine. I had plenty of time to sign up for medical insurance "" which is a cluster of¬†choosing doctor's, plans, sites"", which just made me just give up! But where did my 600 dollar fine go to?¬†Did it go towards my medical need or yours? No it didn't it just went in to the government who deems where it is used for. My money that I put into the system! If it went to my fellow American fine.¬†If it went to the national debt....fine. But millions if not trillions of dollars of people without medical insurance are getting¬†fined, and the money is not going to get you better health care or your family! You are getting ""taxed"" or paying for it no matter what. So I say again Why not universal health care?

Bernie is a very rare Saint in politics. He is like a Pope Francis in politics. Mahatma Gandhi and Mother Teresa would have been proud of him and would certainly have endorsed Bernie Sanders. Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela would have approved.
I have watched with amazement and admiration his speeches and debates. I have read about his life. He voted against the war in Iraq. I agree with him that judgement is more important than mere experience. We must not forget that there were no Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) found in Iraq. We must not forget that about 4497 Americans have died in Iraq and over 32021 Americans wounded. Between 500,000 - 1 million Iraqis died, among them 112,000 - 123,000 were innocent Iraqi civilians. Who will comfort the grieving families? We owe it to those who died and to those who are wounded to make the right choice for President of the most powerful country on earth. We must not forget that the Middle East is in a deep mess right now partly because of the wrong war in Iraq. The world is watching the United States Presidential election and the world is following Bernie Sanders. Millions who normally would not follow the US elections are now keenly interested. All because of Bernie Sanders. Yes some are interested in Donald Trump too. But Bernie is the rock star. 
The number one rule in successful foreign policy is to have trust and integrity. Bernie has authenticity, sincerity and the credibility to win over foreign leaders and nations. I trust Bernie to lead not only America but the whole world.
People across the world are following Bernie Sanders wishing that he becomes the next President of the United States. He is inspiring hope in Asia, Africa, South America, Europe and other parts of the world. 
Having myself been an elected legislator and parliamentarian at both the State and Federal/National level in India, the largest democracy in the world, I have striven all my life to live by my conscience because we owe it to the poor. I realize how hard it is to keep clean and honest in politics where big money is constantly tempting you. I recognise a fellow traveller in Senator Bernie Sanders.
I humbly appeal to all Americans, Democrat, Republican, Independents, all white Americans, all African-Americans, all Latino Americans, all Native Americans, all Asian Americans, all Americans of Indian origin, men and women, young and old and people of all races and political backgrounds to support this Saint in politics. Bernie sometimes brings tears to my eyes when he speaks which testifies to his authenticity. Giving young people free college and university education is the right step if America is to become and remain the leader in education. Those who say that America cannot afford it should remember that the Iraq War cost the US over $2 trillion and counting. So from the land of Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Teresa and from the foothills of the Himalayas, I support and salute you Senator Bernie Sanders. I do not have a vote but I offer you moral and spiritual support. I dedicate my book ‚ÄúLiving Heaven Here on Earth ‚Äì Finding the Divinity Within You‚Äù to Bernie Sanders. You have my intense prayers. I hope that you become the next President of the United States of America. Feel the Bern.

2016-02-06T14:20:06Z,@jesp999,ti2Nokoq1J4,"Hillary's supporters might find she is being accused unfairly of not having a backbone, What some people, even Hillary does not realize, is that the information you know depends directly on your own ability to stand alone and investigate things with intelligent judgement, and seek out information from the right sources. Therefore, corporate influence also takes to form of the influence of who you spend time with. So if you have to raise money you are spending time talking to and with those people all the time. Corporate influence is to be around the people in power and in the roles of power. So corporate power giving money to politicians it is not always a outwardly blatant bribery model, like they are paying you to pass this or that bill, they wrote. It is an influence model, and they use many many subtle tactics in that. They constantly feed you information when you are always hanging out and spending your time with the wrong people. So who you hang out with does influence your character. There is a recent video on youtube where a young person confronts Hillary on Fracking and Hillary does not say she will try to oppose fracking forcefully and she does say she thinks there are ways it can be done safely without accidents or errors. This is a good example of corporate interest being subtle. I live in colorado I have seen how coporations put out false studys on fracking. I had a landlord who was on a pretty high position in the Colorado government and we had a conversation about fracking a few years ago, and he a friend to and always supported. Govenor Hickenlooper. One day ending a meeting with my landlord i told him I was late to a fracking protest i was attending and he gave me a speech about how fracking is not dangerous so i engaged him in a conversations. He was a Democrat and a nice guy, He is a father and a caring person and want in his heart to help others. But he was feed a lot of lies and false information. He was not wise on the fact because the information he had was all fed to him by the corporations. He told me how the corporations actually took him out to fracking sites to ""show him and Hickenlooper"" how safe it was. After some time spent listening to my analysis of empirical evidence and also scientific questions about the nature of volatile gas underground. he finally said because he actually heard me, ""maybe your right about fracking being harmful and dangerous and maybe the information I have been fed is incorrect or biased."" he eventually said. but the time he spent with me those few years i rented from his was only one or two days a year. If you did a statistical study of him and Hickenloopers time, they spend more time hanging out with and raising money with corporate power. And he had little time to investigate things from a fresh perspective on his own in a scientific and rational way. Therefore the corporate influence is not always the outer apparent power of giving candidates money and outwardly bribing them to pass bills in your interests (and that does happen) but the influence of corporations is much more how they infest the government with their interests over the peoples interests in a tactful and more duplicitous way. To get money out of politics means that the politicians will spend more time with the people and therefore will be more influenced by the people and represent them, and less influencable by corporations like the oil companies who even know about Human caused climate change but then who make false science to say there is no climate change to just keep their destructive business model going. Goverment has to be independent of corporate influences. And in most places the fracking corporations have been able to override the local decisions baring fracking. If you watch Gasland you can see that the way power is set up right now when something is harming people it is actually too late when people find out it is bad, and to create the government regulations to stop it. The cooperate first does the bad things and years and years later people might be able to stop it, but its too late. Especially in climate change.and in how our lives are shaped we need government to support the peoples power to shape our own destiny. In terms of climate change we need to act faster and have real independent real science and real people power changing things, we cannot leave that up to the crony capitalistic corporate money greed interests to. The same goes for the military industrial complex and their selling of weapons and so on. We cannot have greed and corporations and military getting us into wars and all that. We need to put the power back into the interests of the people.",2016-02-06T14:20:06Z

And the media just acts like Hillary is the only real player in town. 
Americans, please don't vote for Hillary just because she is a woman. She has many shitty ideas and is pretty conservative and will probably push your security state even further. And you shouldn't vote for Trump either, just because he isn't acting all PC. I know it's very appealing to actually hear somebody in the political theater to speak like that and not like a snake, but please he's not going to help you and because the US is so immensely powerful the whole world is going to suffer the consequences for your voting.

Saudi-Arabia aren't refraining from fighting ISIL because they don't dare to - it is because a part of Saudi-Arabia directly supports them. 

America has to think very carefully about which organisations they support with military supplies in this conflict so that the US along with several European states do not repeat the mistake of funding new terrorist groups (ISIL included).",2016-02-04T16:57:44Z

The fact that working class people support him with small contributions speaks to the true idea of democracy in a country where apparantly you need a big purse to run a succesfull campaign. So my question is: where does O'Malley get his campaign funding? i.e the SuperPAC's Bernie is talking about or rather small campaign donors.

The concept of 'free' education, healthcare and all the rest is a lie to win your vote. Why? Because the government will use YOUR money to pay for this 'free' stuff, by increasing your taxes. All three democrat candidates support tax increase for the middleclass and up (fact). Did you really think you will recieve all this for free? In what world do you live? 

So if, in the near future, your country's president is Sanders or Hitlery, and you are working an 8 hour shift of which benefits you have to pay more than 50% in taxes (also because the increased government size costs TRILLIONS and will be paid with YOUR tax money), all the non-working welfare people willbe very thankful of you. 

This being said, if you are going to vote democrat, than that's totally fine! Please vote for Bernie and NOT for Hitlery, because Hitlery will destroy your country more than Obama (who has accumilated the debt towards 20 TRILLION, and divided  you amongst race, political preference, and increased the unemployment of black people to more than 20%).

The government should not have to care for us from cradle to grave. That should not be the role of a government, but it should be the role of the people. Take for instance healthcare. The government's role in one's life should be to ensure freedom and liberty. But healthcare should be our own responsibility. And for those who cannot care for themselves, through no fault of their own, should be cared for by their fellow man, out of human decency, out of humanity, out of love. Before we had government healthcare and all the bureaucracy that followed with it, how did the poor obtain healthcare in the United States? It was provided by charities, by churches, by friends and family members. Doctors would care for them for free, pro-bono. No one allowed anyone to suffer needlessly. There were many religious doctors and people with a soul, with a conscience, that even devoted their lives to care for the poor and not for monetary gain. And the cost of healthcare and insurance back then was a fraction of what it is now. The reason why education and healthcare is so expensive in this country is because of unintended consequences from decisions made with the very best of intentions. I'll try to give a short and practical explanation. If the easy and free credit for student loans dried out today, and no one could take out a loan to attend a good college, you would see empty colleges. And colleges then would either be forced to go out of business, or lower their costs and expenses. Today you see colleges adding building to building, facility after facility, like a nuclear arms race, to attract students and their extremely hefty loans that make them a tremendous profit. All of this unnecessary waste and spending would be eliminated, and education would again be affordable. But even online schools with a fraction of the operating cost of a brick and mortar school charge almost the same amount. And why? Because they can, and who wouldn't if they were in their position, if the people are willing to take out an enormous loan and pay for it.",2016-01-28T13:16:20Z

It doesn't matter how high the debt gets because as long the interest is under control you can start working on paying it back after the economy gets back on track. Focusing on the debt when the economy is in shambles is the real dangerous thinking. If the government takes focus away from fixing the economy to try and fix the debt ""problem"" (it really isn't a problem) then it will only worsen the economy which will mean the government will collect less in revenue which will just make the debt worse.¬†",2016-02-25T20:28:36Z
2016-02-25T21:35:23Z,@mattbenz99,ti2Nokoq1J4,MetalDetroit¬†You seemingly don't understand how government debt works. The whole point of a government taking out debt is to invest it back into the economy.

Here is the problem with your theory. The U.S. Cannot possibly - EVER pay off this debt.   Here is why people, like Obama, are economic illiterates.  Take the almost one trillion dollar ""Stimuls Package""
Where did the United States get the money for this?

1. Bonds - so the debt is owed to the population
2. Taxes - so the US pulled -1 Trillion OUT of the economy in order to add it back?   Net wash
3. Printing it - so now the value of the currency is lessened.  Harming the poor and middle class.
4. Borrowing it.  Worse case scenario !   Now we have debt we cannot pay off, with Interest on TOP of that debt !

So the 1 Trillion that Obama ""spent"" into the economy, was removed from the economy in the first place, coupled with borrowing from China.

How did that work out?   Don't say it wasn't enough, because it was MORE than Obama asked for.  There was zero economic growth from the Stimulus.

The moment the government gets a surplus they can start slowly paying it off. Also people need to stop using Greece as an example of a country destroyed by debt. Greece's problems have much less to do with debt and a lot more to do with the EU screwing them over.¬†

Also deficit spending in order to help the economy is modern economic thought. It is called Keynesian economics and you should probably look it up.¬†",2016-02-25T22:21:41Z

At some point, the debt becomes so large that it CANNOT BE PAID OFF.  Do you realize that we are nearing that point?  As for Keynsian economics, deficit spending is meant to get out of a short term recession to inject money into the economy to ""prime the pump"". NOT 30 + years of accumulated deficits leading to a debt that will turn future generations into economic slaves !",2016-02-25T23:06:29Z
2016-02-25T23:15:03Z,@mattbenz99,ti2Nokoq1J4,MetalDetroit¬†There hasn't been a deficit for 30 years. Clinton left office with a surplus and Bush overspent and then the housing market crashed leading to a recession. Since 2008 the government has had no choice but to spend in order to help the economy. You argument is a straw man because I never said I wanted to have deficits forever. Eventually you do need to pay off the debt but that time is not now. The time for that is when the economy gets back on track. Also economic slaves is an appeal to emotion and is a logical fallacy.

Also, due to lack of mental care/jobs/school, depression and other mental illnessess are an epidemic right now. people often eat their feelings away. If it's too hard to get out of bed, you won't make a healthy smoothie. you just grab something quick and easy. people don't care about their bodies and so dont the major corporations. they feed of of people's problems, and bernie is trying to stop these corporations from doing so",2016-06-25T00:16:45Z

2016-01-26T05:30:29Z,@cbarcus,ti2Nokoq1J4,"What a wonderful debate!

Lots of great and even inspiring comments from all of the participants. 

Sanders is the angry democratic-socialist activist who tended to repeat himself while accusing various institutions of conspiracy and corruption from the beginning to the very end. At times I enjoyed his passion, even if his ideas are not particularly well sorted out. Definitely the least presidential in my view, but he still made important contributions to the debate.

""It is beyond my comprehension how we can elect a president of the United States, somebody like Trump, who believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese.""

O'Malley spoke on the importance of cooperation and opportunity:

‚ÄúWe cannot keep talking past each other, declaring all Republicans are our enemies. We are one. Our cause is one.‚Äù

""The greatest business opportunity to come to America is climate change.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on the threshold of a new era of American progress.‚Äù

""If Donald Trump wants to start a registry in our country of people by faith, he can start with me. I will sign up as one who is totally opposed to his fascist appeals that want to vilify Muslim Americans.‚Äù


But Clinton nailed it. She is by far the most experienced and capable of these candidates, and it is clear that she is committed to improving our nation. Too bad she did not get a chance to talk about climate, but she is giving important support to nuclear power.

‚ÄúI will go anywhere to meet with anyone at any time to find common ground.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want us to defend and build on the affordable care act and improve it.‚Äù

""There needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.""

""But the fact is, we have the Affordable Care Act. That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.""

""Because maybe you can't only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party, but who knows. If you're successful there, maybe you can build even more. That's what I would do.""

""The Dodd-Frank bill and then to sign it was one of the most important regulatory schemes we've had since the 1930s. So I'm going to defend Dodd- Frank and I'm going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the financial industry and getting results.""

""Well, I'm very proud of the Iran Nuclear Agreement. I was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office. I was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed which put the pressure on Iran. It brought them to the negotiating table which resulted in this agreement.""",2016-01-26T05:30:29Z

Socialism is the 'way' and communism is the 'goal'. To make it simple, it's what they have in N.Korea for example, absolute control by government and absolute equality in every aspect of life.
On the other hand, democrat socialism is a 'fix' to capitalism to overcome the increasing inequality this system naturally creates. An example of this could be the Scandinavian countries.",2016-02-11T14:47:15Z

Do you realize that the gap has massively widened during the Obama administration?   Do you wonder why?    How can Democrats sit there and attack Republicans as being ""pro rich"" or ""pro- business"" then attack American Businesses, and seek to punish them for profits, driving Production and operations overseas, and then sit there and lament about the poor and middle class?!   Don't you see the correlation?    Pfizer just moved operations to Ireland, they are going to save BILLIONS in taxes. Ireland has a 14% tax rate. Pfizer was paying 35%. During the Obama administration, the country has dropped from the 6th best country in the world to the 11th.   Sanders policies will be WORSE for business.

Anyway, the answer for companies that want to take bussiness away for better profits is relatively simple, you just make it not profitable for them via taxes, including possible expropriations. It's just that it goes against free market, and we all know US is worlwide famous for defending this concept.

2016-02-11T17:46:58Z,@MetalDetroit,ti2Nokoq1J4,"So in making it less profitable, you have just drivin up the cost of the products that the company sells.

Right, nice shifting of goal-posts. You claimed Sanders only increases taxes on marginal income. I have shown that you are wrong.

Moving on, it's only a *claim* that there will be net savings. Given how inefficient Medicare and Medicaid are, Trump's claim of getting Mexico to pay for his wall, has more validity.

2016-03-12T06:03:08Z,@aliciakhoo7238,ti2Nokoq1J4,"+Ben Pon Great question. First of all, let me say people like Joe Jack are just an example of the broken US educational system, and puppets of media propaganda mindcontrol who kneejerk at the mention of ""taxes"" and ""socialism."" The idea of socialism is not new but the  political theorist who popularized it was Karl Marx. Karl Marx envisioned a utopia where everybody was one big loving community without any worries of healthcare, everyone was equally paid, there was no ""inequality."" This stemmed from a basic universal compassion for mankind and yearning for peace and unity of the human race as brethren. There is a major flaw in Marx's theory, however: just because we are equal in human dignity and inherent worth does not mean we are equal in our talents and contribution. 1) Some people are better at fixing cars, and some people are better at fixing brains. 2) People would pay more to have their brains fixed than their car fixed, naturally. 3) Competition drives progress and innovation. Then again, which you can clearly see manifest that the abolition of classes in society just does not work. Man's design is hierarchical. Therefore, radical Marxists like Mao, Pol Pot, etc all failed miserably in their vision for a ""utopia."" This is why Christians believe in ""Heaven,"" and Buddhists believe in Nirvana. It is man's yearning for utopia. The surrendering of all civilian rights to the state is a dangerous thing. Communism can be defined as ""extreme socialism."" However, socialism in itself, in theory, is not evil. It is human beings who cannot conform to this system naturally without causing a huge power imbalance and inertia. Countries that have attempted socialism that has kept civilian rights (freedom of speech,  in check have been extremely successful, for e.g., Norway, Sweden, Denmark, France,  etc, they enjoy a quality of life that far surpasses the United States. Indeed they have higher income taxes, however, their incomes are much higher compared to a US person of the same position/skill set. In addition, the lack of burden on healthcare and education frees these people's pockets up to have more leisure money, and lessens mental health troubles from stress and anxiety of having to pay for medical care. When I lived in France, bakeries close for the entire month of August because the French are on some scuba diving trip in Mauritius or Phi Phi Island. People do not worry about healthcare, when they get sick, they go to a doctor without thinking ""Do I have insurance or money to pay for my tetanus infection??."" When they want to go to med school, they simple show up and register. When I was in Norway, the cost of living made my jaw drop yet the quality of living was unparalleled. They are not perfect, but they are doing pretty well. I hope to see more intelligent discussion in youtube forums instead of kneejerk responses like Joe Jack's. If that can't be curbed, then I'm just sorry the education system failed you.",2016-03-12T06:03:08Z

His authenticity is based on what he says he believes, rather than the actual outcome. In his proposed idea of ""medicare for all"" he stated it would cost $1.38 trillion dollars a year but save people/businesses $6 tril a year. Gerald Friedman being a professor of Economics at the University of Massachusetts estimated this would cost a minimal of $15 trillion a year, to include other social programs costing another $3.5 trillion dollars.  

He's as overly ambitious and clueless as Obama was in his introduction to ObamaCare where he stated ""no one would lose their doctors."" which by looking at every shred of evidence was an absolute lie. Good read: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/dec/12/lie-year-if-you-like-your-health-care-plan-keep-it/


 Like most Democratic candidates, he's a complete donors puppet with his $222.2M campaign (which is sad considering he's going to lose.) You can paint socialism anyway you'd like, it's certainly different for everyone these days. In response to your second question, Communism is simply perfect world socialism which is why it ultimately fails. His contrast from being a full on libtard is that he has no intention of setting states to own banks/private businesses. I'm sure if he actually had the power to do so he would, the constitution/checks and balances shall and will always prevent this.

Obamacare is the most recent reform of the healthcare system in America.  Originally,  President Obama called for a single-payer system (similar to what Bernie wants), but that did not receive sufficient political support at the time.  Obamacare is offered through private insurance companies, but the states can set up insurance exchanges in order to try to get better rates and it became illegal to deny people health coverage on account of pre-existing medical conditions.  Additionally, young people were allowed to stay on their parents health plans until they were 26 years old.


Obamacare extended healthcare to millions of people who lacked it previously, and was a major step forward, but it is still flawed.  Prescription drug prices continue to rise rapidly (though the rate of increase has slowed somewhat), and since the insurance is still private it still becomes ""for people who can afford it"" after a point.  Also, the degree of state control over the program meant that many Republican governors, who opposed Obamacare (and most of whatever else the President did) were able to obstruct aspects of the program's operation in their states, such as the establishment of the health insurance exchanges.


Bernie was one of the authors of the final Obamacare law, but he had wanted more ambitious reforms, such as single payer (the government takes over the role of the health insurance companies, though private insurance may still exist for those who want it), and he is trying to rally support for said reforms during his presidential campaign.  He wants to make access to  healthcare a fundamental right of all citizens, to be paid for with modestly increased taxes on the middle class and substantially higher taxes on the wealthy and stock market speculation.",2016-01-23T19:13:39Z

For instance, Hillary Clinton wants to build upon Obamacare, which gave more people health insurance but still leaves 29 million uninsured, many more underinsured, as well as countless families with high premiums. Sanders wants to move to a single payer system; his plan is to raise taxes slightly to pay for it, though most families would pay less in these taxes than they would¬†with private insurance, meaning they would save money under Bernie's plan.

The only issue Hillary Clinton seems to be left of Bernie Sanders on is gun control, though that's probably just because she has been advocating for it more strongly, as they tend to agree on many gun control policies.

It's because the Affordable Care Act required private insurance companies to insure people regardless of their medical history. By absorbing more risk, insurance companies have raised premiums across the board (even the premiums healthy people pay). The ACA isn't nearly as good as Clinton touts it. On that one feature alone, one could argue it's a disaster. The reason why Sanders is right on healthcare is very simple: single-payer is a single-buyer environment. Most people are familiar with monopolies: a single seller environment which usually results in higher prices. Berniecare is essentially a monopsony: a single buyer environment that results in lower prices. In this case, the only buyer is the government. Of course this will lower healthcare costs for people.

Safe means nothing that's wrong gets better. Safe means stagnation and, eventually, deterioration. Entropy demands some dreaming and some bravery to make those dreams happen. You think the safe choice freed black people from slavery? You think it got women the right to vote and black people the right to vote? You think the safe choice is where the American Dream came from? This country has been built not just on the backs of millions of hardworking people, but on the backs of dreamers and visionaries who were themselves hardworking people. Visions don't become reality by staying inside and letting those visions fall away as distant memories of what might have been. 

A guy like Bernie Sanders, with the kind of track record he has and the kind of genuine campaign he has, comes once in a lifetime. You can ignore him and choose what you deem as ""safe,"" or you can open the door, go outside, and face the fear head on. Bernie Sanders represents the power of grassroots effort - the power of democracy and community. And our history says that it works. The civil rights movement says it works. The woman's suffrage movements says it works. 

History is on our side and so is Bernie. Hilary may be a good talking head, but safe won't make reform happen. And you can believe Bernie is ineffective, but you also could have believed MLK was ineffective 50 years ago and look where we are now. And yet, even with that in mind, you have to ignore the fact that Bernie has gone way up in the polls over time, almost entirely through grassroots effort. In a matter of months.

2016-01-26T01:39:56Z,@TransparentLabyrinth,ti2Nokoq1J4,"Walter Ruiz
We are limited to what we have, but the crazy thing - and I say this from personal experience - is the resources we have, compared to what we tend to think we have. Our imaginations are notoriously great at ideas, but they're poor at grasping onto details and while the common trope is to think that our imagination's detail limitations is working against us... sometimes it's just the opposite. Sometimes we vastly underestimate the resources at our disposal precisely because our imaginations are so limited in seeing the details.

That's where the ""dreams can come true"" trope is born from. Not from our imagination itself, but from the experience of seeing in detail what human strength can accomplish, sometimes above and beyond our wildest dreams.

But I understand the limitations of reality. When I drive my car, I don't expect it to drive myself. And I know that no president's stay in office will last forever. But I believe in the power of perspective for making progress; I believe in showing people what can be accomplished - showing them how much untapped and unused potential is rotting away useless in a bin. It's why I support Obama's efforts on health care, even if I'm not in love with the exact application of it; he fought hard and showed this country that government health care is more than something ""other countries do."" It can be real here. People like Bernie, MLK, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton didn't get their message across instantly and they didn't make progress instantly. They aren't wizards and I don't expect wizardy. But what they all have in common is that they stuck to a cause for the people and by the people throughout their lives, in the face of opposition.

That kind of tenacity for rights and freedoms isn't a thing you can manufacture around a strategic campaign table because campaigns don't last a lifetime. I don't expect Bernie to solve all of the country's problems if he gets elected; I expect him to remind this country what grassroots tenacity and democracy look like. And he already has done that with his campaign. It's just a question of how much further he can take it. And how far he can take it will forever be helped along by the people who stand beside him as a community.

Bernie, like MLK, like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, like countless other activists of their time, are unwavering figureheads who make history, but nothing is stronger than the support of the people who back them. Their true strength is in being the rock in a tempestuous sea.

They remind us that we don't have to let the political sea buffet us around. We can do something about it. I've never thought of myself as a patriot, but I tell you, the USA is a country that has space for grassroots efforts and the value of that is immeasurable.",2016-01-26T01:39:56Z

And you really think New York will go for Hillary? ¬†In September of 2015, she was only at 45%, down from 65% only a few month prior. ¬†As the race has progressed, Clinton has declined across the board and Sanders has risen, so I find it hard to believe she would go phoenix and rise from the ashes in New York when she lost 20 points in less than a year (and when you consider at that time, Joe Biden was one of the choices).

Let's face it, Shillary won't win New York, and if she wins Florida, I'm not sure it will matter, given that, by that point, Bernie will have already won several caucuses. ¬†New Hampshire is a lock for Bernie, as is Vermont. ¬†He's ahead in Iowa right now, 3 days from the election... ¬†When/If he wins Iowa, that's two back to back caucus wins with a few weeks before the next one. ¬†That's going to show EVERYONE that has been clinging to this ""I'll vote Hillary because Sanders can't win"" that they fell for more Clinton campaign bullshit.

The single payer is paid for by either federal government or state by putting a levy on taxes or fuel which in turn is enough to pay for all your medicines and treatment.

Men block women from opportunities just because we are women.  This is not about hillary per say but all the women that are suffering under a steel not glass ceiling some men create because they don&#39;t want to compete against us or think we are just too emotional.  those sterotypes are just as lame as the ones against black people, hispanic people, muslim people period.  so i agree with you.  we just need a good matter fact extraordinary president it just so happens its Hillary!  You denied her once, not again!!! #YouBettaGoHillary #ShowThem  - One other thing.  My republicans friends are really worried that democrats like hillary will punish them and the free market based on how they have treated the country in the past when they made mistakes in the leadership they chose.  This is a false choice.  Republican voters were lied to just like all voters.  Bills were passed to place chemicals from companies in fresh water lakes and ponds that were used by people for drinking water.  Can someone explain me why we would have EVER passed something like that?  I am more than willing to vote for any candidate or party if they get their sh*t together and stop allowing the worst of their party to beat them at this political game.  I am sorry, but I love my morning joe.  U want to know why? because that show is how we should be operating getting along, treating each other with mutual respect knowing we are all in the same boat.  ALL of the issues we are dealing with will impact all of us.  If the Atlantic ocean hiccups, areas around manhattan are toast until the water recedes.  Also women still make 77 cents on the dollar to men.  So don&#39;t talk to me about needing a good president.  I know that already.  And it should not be partisan or based on sex.  However, there are still men to this day that disrespect women in so many ways. So if you don&#39;t want a female president fine.  But I want one.  Finally, men will stop being so disrespectful towards their better half.  Not all men are like that. However the men that wouldn&#39;t mind having a women leading them are the men i want leading my country.  This like the election of Barack will make a world of difference in showing world how to treat a women equally. We can stop some of the worldwide violence and discrimination against women just like we are now working on century long system racism against AA.  There are those of us that are tired of this back and forth - and tired of our world changing every freaking 4 to 8 years.

2016-01-28T05:23:28Z,@TheAbsyte22,ti2Nokoq1J4,"Toney Sebits¬†I get your point. ¬†I am hesitant to vilify Hillary over Bernie, just because Bernie has a slight better record than Hillary. ¬†They all at one time or another have made a politically expedient vote in Congress. ¬†Bernie has a voting record on gun laws that in some ppls eyes is ""shameful"". ¬†At the end of the day the nature of the culture of DC can turn any good standing Senator or HR into a poor representation of their party. ¬†I guess for me its a matter of the lesser of two evils. ¬†Not literally but figuratively. ¬†Bernie sometimes sounds a bit wonky on his views and seems very extreme. ¬†Unless we vote all repubs out of office (next to impossible), Bernie will suffer a similar fate as Obama in that I don't know that Repubs will ever take a ""socialist"" seriously. ¬†Look I am looking at the big picture and I want all 3 dem candidates in the administration in 2017. ¬†We the voters need to do our part and vote out any politician that to your point has a poor record and has become a establishment crony unwilling to do the America ppls work. ¬†We have not had a stable government to me in over 35 years. ¬†It is high time, the American ppl speak louder than words with a tremendous wave of votes to indicate that this political body must go and that the democrats we select are pressured just as we would the opposition to #DoRightByTheAmericanPPL. ¬†Quite as kept Bernie is apart of the democratic progressive ""establishment"" even though he is a Independent, his voting record is consistent with the values of the Democratic party and he has been in Congress for a long while. ¬†I would rather investigate, vote and keep demanding of any politician to do right by our country as I have seen most politicians  #fail ¬†at some point or another. ¬†In my post, I am favoring Hillary but at you can see I am a bit agnostic to whether Bernie should lead or Hillary. ¬†I think it would be great for the country and the world to see America go from a AA president where we have dealt with racism in a way our country never has. ¬†With the election of a woman, I believe it would do wonders around the world and open up a slew of concerns and issues women have been facing for more than a century. ¬†I do respect your opinion though and respect the fact that you support Bernie, I support a lot of Bernie's ideas as well. ¬†What I am ultimately after is an end to many of the stale issues we have been dealing with in this country. ¬†We need closure for some of the poor corporate and political decisions that have been made in this country. ¬†I agree political strategies like the one I have suggested may not be feasible but Elizabeth Warren won't run and I can tell you if she had, I stand with you in the belief that she would have been the right woman for the job. ¬†But she didn't and Hillary did. ¬†I know the Clintons believe in American and the safety of our country. ¬†She may not be perfect but it is up to us to keep her and all of the other politicians in line reminding them of who they work for. ¬†Thanks for disagreeing with me and having a great conversation unlike some of the ppl who responded to my post with hostility. ¬†I appreciate you greatly.",2016-01-28T05:23:28Z
2016-01-28T19:36:04Z,@toneysebits8458,ti2Nokoq1J4,"TheAbsyte22 we all want change. Obama did not live up to his hype, although I feel like he tried his best with what he had to work with. He did acomplish some of his goals he promised on, not all but a few. I really feel like Hillary is just going to be another Obama. Status quo, run of the mill, kissing the republicans ass just like Obama. The democrats have lost a lot of power over Obama's rule and I am Not feeling Hillary can stand up more than Obama did, they are far to similar. When you want to get things done you need to shoot for the moon and compromise from there. About the gun lobby votes from Bernie, he addresses that in one of the democratic debates or some interview. You can find a video of it on YouTube if you search. Voting against a lot of those bills would have shut down the government and the bills themselfs were not all that bad, they contained some good things as well. Not worth shutting down the government over. Again I keep getting the vibe of voting for Hilary because she is a woman. When you compare policies and track records it's almost night and day. Bernie has stayed consistent for 40 plus years. Hillary on the other hand has flip flopped on a few things fairly recently too which is a bit concerning and really hurts credibility. Like the flip flop of wanting single payer health care for example, the exact same thing Bernie is for. She used to support that. Very recently too, now she dosent? That is just one example. When you want change you need to support the candidate who offers the most change. You need someone who will not change their ideals no matter what ammount of pressure is put on you and Bernie has proven that, Hillary has not. Of course I would take Hillary any day over any of the republicans. I don't dislike Hillary, I am basing my opinion on what I have seen so far and to me I am willing to put my trust in Bernie. Be sure to question everything though, especially those you strongly support. I supported Hillary untill I heard Bernie speak, did some research, changed my mind. But believe in whatever you want, I am just giving my reasons for my decision, you have yours and that's perfectly fine. The best we can do is try to sway one another into the others point of view.

All that stuff about Hillary is almost all fact with some suspicion and scandals mixed in. what he says about your gender bias is also fact. About Bernie making a better pres, when compared to hillarys record puts Bernie in a much better light because he has almost no suspicious behavior. He also opposed almost all of Clinton's policies that she supported, Iraq war for exmple and we all know how well that worked out lol. So that is also fact. Flat out laughing at things that are true as opinion is a bit mean. I am Not trying to attack you or anything, just trying to point out that what he said was based off of evidence, not personal opinion. EX: Religion is stupid and causes everyone to devalue their current life and the life of others (especially when you are not a part of their religion). Also Religion is simply untrue and is used as an escape for people who can't come to terms with real life and need to make stuff up to feel better about themselfs because they are terrible people and have something to hide. *That is An opinion*.

The first amendment applies to everyone. ¬†You are free to believe what you must or what you want. ¬†I have no obligation to justify to you why I would like to have a female president. ¬†Furthermore some men, much like power in this country and racists seem to think that if you badger ppl they will eventually come to your side or way of thinking. ¬†I am free not enslaved. ¬†I have had ppl threaten me with prison and threaten my life for my views and I ask you in such a public forum is this type of behavior acceptable simply because I have a view you may not agree with. ¬†The correct answer is no. ¬†Men have bias and have executed that bias for centuries - your argument is similar to bigoted ppl and racists who then claim bigotry and reverse racism simply based on the fact that they can not have their way so they claim reverse racism to flip the tables on the person they believe has supposedly gone against them. ¬†As being a part of both minority groups I am a bit tired of self righteous folks telling me or demanding that I change my view because they don't agree. ¬†No sir I am beyond this line of thinking and wish to be left alone with my thoughts. ¬†I responded to a political debate over 2 weeks ago and have now been harassed over and over and over again. ¬†I am done with this conversation. ¬†My grandparents used to shun us if we spoke of politics because of the fact that they were afraid of how people will go to extraordinary lengths to bring harm to those that do not agree with your choice. ¬†We still abide by the constitution and no one has the right to take that freedom away our founding fathers did not intend the 1st amendment to be abused. ¬†Yet some feel as if they have a good given right to intimidate or press beyond the normal limits of free speech. ¬†You have a absolute right to your version of the facts and you have an absolute right to stick to your guns if you believe supposed facts that have not been validated as truth by the state department, Hillary Clinton or otherwise. ¬†What u don't have the right to do is intimidate, slander (read the constitution on slander) or intimidate (even with words) of another person if they just so happen to disagree with you. ¬†Your stance is foolish. ¬†And you should know better. ¬†If you wish to know my rationale as to why I believe Hillary should be president and Bernie should be Vice President then re-read the original post, talk amongst yourselves and have at it. ¬†However if this discussion continues beyond the point of this response, I will have no choice but to report this behavior. ¬†I am asking nicely. ¬†I thank you both for your opinion and support of the candidate of your choice. ¬†Its your choice as a voter not mine or anyone else. ¬†Similarly it is your choice to believe or misconstrue facts to fit your liking. ¬†I am at least humble enough to simply state my opinion and move on - you both should consider the same. ¬†Have a great day guys. ¬†Period. ¬†That's it. ¬†Good day.",2016-02-18T23:09:35Z

Where they found that many Independents I have no clue, but clearly Bernie, with a 2/3 pool of voices was going do better in that poll.  We call it Fixing the Mix.

So lots of people were lying; I've done it, haven't you? You would get better info if a monkey threw darts.

Despite all the well-intentioned plans from career politicians, once they get into office we keep ending up with the same results - either bigger government or bigger mega-corporations. And neither is good for the middle class.Where I'm seeing good changes in the country it is being driven by the people, not the politicians, with places like www.change.org having a good impact on making changes. And peer to peer lending like Prosper that take the usurious banks out of the picture.I'm a bit tired of all the politicians that have begun to think they are the ones deciding what is best for the people due to their beliefs and/or those of their donors. I think it's time the government got back to working for the people, instead of dictating what they want on the people with regards to gun control, abortion, etc... - what happened to the country being a democracy? I think it's time the government got out of the way, so the people can get back to work fixing what the politicians and wealthy have so badly broken with the country. And the people are trying to do that, again, at a more grass-roots level via things like Kickstarter, etc...Free education for everyone? Why? We still need plumbers and people patching potholes, and many things that don't need the additional education of a college degree. Maybe go back to apprenticeships (no pun intended there) to help those starting out get a start in a good direction, guided by more experienced mentors?My thoughts, at least... government should focus on the bigger things that the people can't do alone - foreign relations, which have not been good for quite a while; mega-corporation regulations that actually work to keep them from becoming too big with too much influence; the agricultural industry, which seems driven largely by the Farm bill, and which seems to be promoting bad practices in what we farm, and what we eat.The plan I'd like to hear about, is the plan to take 'career politician' off the table as a career choice. If I remember correctly from my visit to Mt. Vernon a few years ago - the public wanted George Washington to do a third term as president. He said no, his time was up, and he went back to running his business. I'd like to see that mentality in our elected government. Do your time, then go back to work.

There is no invisible hand of the market that sets things in place (as Adams took Locke's thought to the extreme) corporations are running our government and the regulations and taxes that Bernie plans are only to stop the corporations from setting all the laws in their favor so you pay your taxes but they don't pay theirs.

Seriously, how is one expected to defend themselves against our own military in the event of the government acquiring too much power over the people? Look around the world at all the countries that have fallen to dictators. One of the very first steps is to take away their needed freedoms without them fully understanding the gravity of what is happening. It is a human right to be able to defend ourselves. If you can't agree on the fact that the United States defense spending is outrageous, and that it is the most advanced military operations in the world, or the possibility of invasion by other countries, among a myriad of other possibilities, the least one person should be able to do is defend themselves to the highest degree. Having a weapon of mass destruction in the possession of every person, something capable of killing millions at a time, now that is something to be worried about. Do I think weapons are silly? Yes, I truly do not think anybody should even need them. We really do not. But the unfortunate situation is that there are people that grow up thinking, or are taught, that it is every man for himself, peace is too good to be true, people who wear turbans are enemies, my religious views are right and everyone else is going to burn in hell, etc.. And this leads to much conflict around the world, not to mention the absurd class division created by the useless monetary systems which only guarantees that of poverty and strife to exist. And this kind of conflict leads people to do terrible things to one another. And until we have a massive swing in values among each person around the world, a fully automatic, high powered, AR-15 is not too much to ask for, but the point is, our founding fathers wanted to create a country in which its people are truly free. And that means the public rules. The public by mass decision through representation decides how the country is ran. And the people writing the constitution realized how things can become corrupt, and as a preventative measure they wanted to make sure the public has the right to arm themselves. So instead of saying we should all have nukes as well, think about the social situations in our country as well as around the world. Think long and hard about what makes people do the things they do. And you should also think that a self respecting person who abides by the law is not outrageous for wanting the same fallacies given by the government to the armed forces.¬†",2016-01-20T20:49:32Z

Its the about the choices an individual makes. The 77% that everyone wants you to believe is the gender pay gap is false since they are taking the median from all full time jobs in the country. That is like comparing a male engineers' salary to a female elementary school teachers' salary. There has been research done (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis) that shows that women earn about 95% of what a man earns for the same job. The other 5% wage gap is caused by two factors. The first is that women are much less likely to negotiate their salaries compared to their male counterparts (There are numerous experiments published that show this, you can find them on the internet). The second is that women are more often than not the primary nurturers of a families children. They are not able to fully commit to their work whereas men can do so more often.
That leaves leaves only a slim possibility that women have lower wages due to gender discrimination.",2016-01-20T04:35:37Z

Meanwhile, the 2 other candidates could just ask for time and have it handed to them. 


That said, Bernie should get the nomination. I just wish I could have heard O'Malley more because he seems to have some good views.",2016-01-20T03:19:37Z

The European Union members or countries,for argument reason and space I use up, let's see Germany, high taxes compared to the US because those colleges aren't free so the citizens have to compensate by paying more taxes. People don't realize that we Americans are having trouble just paying taxes, especially middle class families and lower class families. That small add will make a ton of difference in taxes. So at least make it affordable, so students are prepared for the workforce with experience what jobs like and tend to be biased toward. People forget that House Speaker (can be compared to the gate guard of Congress) allows bills to go in with his permission and can deny their access. The bill is processed through the House will voted for and won't pass if it doesn't get approval. The the Senate is their to be the door stopper or re-editor, or rechecked the bill if need be. There's been a recent lack of bipartisanship as both sides seem to draft away, at opposite directions. So we need compromise and President Obama understood that and made the Affordable Care Act favorable by both Republicans and Democrats. Hillary understands that and so she'll add to that so that both sides work closer together. Breaking big banks avoids big collapses from the big banks but is not adoptive for global economic reasons, which big banks are however. Money is always a big factor in political success even before the Citizens United vs the FEC court ruling, it has and will always be big factor, no matter what law you impose if you get that law to pass somehow on super PACS. Money is always big in elections and in politics, just the amount grew, which I can see.",2016-01-23T17:14:47Z

The ONLY reason for international trade, when your country is self-sustaining, is to make money. ¬†If the money is being made because of labor costs, the wealthier of the societies will always suffer, since the natural economic shift tends towards an equilibrium.

This is why we need much higher tariffs. ¬†If we don't even out the price of labor in developing countries (such as in Asia) we have no long-term chance of turning the poverty tide. ¬†Let's be real, more people are impoverished today than in 1955 and the only stark economic differences between 1955 and today is the influx of foreign labor markets.

We have modern day royalty, which this country was founded against. Now billionaires can buy out politicians and elections, and the vast majority of people will vehemently defend this corrupt system against their own interest. Why would you trust anyone who is bought and paid for and think they might have your best interest at heart? Why would anybody support that?

Therefore colleges will be quite a bit harder to get into than it is now. If colleges somehow do not get harder to get accepted than what happened with high school will happen with college. Back in the day, not everyone went to high school so having a high school diploma was something that gave graduates an edge over non-graduates. High school became standardized so people began going to college to get an edge over people who did not go to college. If college becomes free and standardized than grad school or professional school is where people are going to go to make themselves more desirable over everyone else.

Most of my friends are moderates. Trump, don't take literally, well I don't. Ted is a pariah amongst his own party, even to his friends. There's good candidates that are running they just turned crazy to get votes. But when it comes to the general election they may change. Which candidate caught your eye? And why? How do you see the scope of government? Any answer is good. I'm moderate because I don't like expanding the scope of government unless it helps. Just want to see.

There are eight levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.
The first is the most important.
 
Healthcare‚Äì Control healthcare and you control the people.
Poverty ‚Äì Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.
Debt ‚Äì Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.
Gun Control ‚Äì Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state
Welfare ‚Äì Take control of every aspect of their lives. (Food, Housing, and Income)
Education ‚Äì Take control of what people read and listen to us‚Äú take control of what children learn in school.
Religion ‚Äì Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.
Class Warfare ‚Äì Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.",2016-01-19T07:19:55Z

Obama has been there for 8 years, so 'another 4 years' doesn't make that much sense.

It's ironic that you want to embrace 'change' whilst having such animosity for Obama, but clearly support Trump.

Its also ironic that you use the words 'change' and 'again' in the same sentence.

Going backwards isn't really 'change' - and what Trump intends to do will not make America great.

If you want change as you claim, and something truly different - Bernie Sanders is the only candidate that fits the bill, Trump isn't really any different from the previous republican candidate - a rich guy who tells you he'll be good with money because he has a lot of it - but has some shady business dealings and failures in his past that would definitely suggest otherwise.

Build a wall, spend money on the military, tell people you're strong and have values - that's not a new gig man, that's the same stuff you're fed every time. . . .",2016-01-20T07:31:13Z

Very small I think Sweden has a population of around 4 million vs the 300+million we have in the US. The Scandinavian countries are also mostly people of the same race/religion/beliefs etc. They also pay the highest taxes than any other country in the world. The Nordic democracy system also relies on its citizen to have a strong trust in their government which many americans do not due to our corrupt politicians. The people their are also very xenophobic and don't have nearly as many immigrants as we do in the US. They have a vast amount of wealth from their oil industry which allows them to provide their citizens with these public provided services. Comparing how things work in those countries is a terrible premise for an argument. It isn't even apples to oranges. In the US we have capitalistic Ideals, you don't see scandinavian Microsoft, or Apple, or Google. There's a good reason why those are American companies, now when we focus on what works for our country it isn't just to tax the rich, which he says the millionaires and billionaires but in reality anybody who makes over 250k/year get taxed up to 40% of their income. That is not fair, I know plenty of people who make that much who have worked their way from their bachelor's and master's and started at their companies from the bottom to the income they have now, these people aren't the corrupt millionaires they are hard working families.

2016-01-19T08:08:47Z,@kool2btrue,ti2Nokoq1J4,"+Joshua Bribiesca technically both should happen. The real problem we are seen is that prices are going up anyway and people are getting priced out of being able to afford living. I am a 23 y.o. software engineer making a healthy amount of money annually. Regardless I will never be able to afford a house as things stand. I really cannot imagine how people making 1/2 of what I make with 20K student loans manage to survive.  I originally come from very low income and my mother still lives in a poorer area. Even there the cost of living and food is increasing to levels far beyond the wages provided in the area. It is clear to me that if I want my mother to not live in a garage I will have to subsidize her living for the rest of her life. How are other people going to manage this? Mind you I do have high skill career but no one should live in a tiny box if they are working 40 hours a week.


Now about business owners. yes it will have an impact on them. First big companies. You should probably look at workers more in terms of production and hours of work each body provides. If big companies need 400,000 hours a week of work they better hire 400,000 hours of work. Cutting people will likely cut profits as production and dissatisfaction increases unless they were already saturated. It will make investors gain less but workers gain more. It does however, impact small business owners negatively, particularly a small business trying to take off that hired quite some people it can barely afford.  That said it should be pointed out that said workers being paid minimum wage are already living a sub-par existence so we are already in a less than ideal situation. This is basically bargaining for the  quality of life of the business owners vs that of the employees.


This anecdotal evidence, but I personally never met a business owner with employees under him/her that is not living in a far better economic position than the employees. I don't think business owners should be in prop 8 housing but it is clear that favoring their quality of life over the employees is not working for our economy. I think it is time to shift the wealth downwards somewhat toward the working people because that trickle-down economic theory that has been in effect for decades is wiping out our middle class.",2016-01-19T08:08:47Z

But to be honest these companies should have gone out a long time ago, wal mart is a prime example who used the low wages to crush all competition. capitalism should be about who offers the best products/quality and thus generates the most consume not who can undercut whom leaving everyone too poor to even consume anywhere else then at these markets that they work at.",2016-01-20T03:36:20Z

If they are going to raise the minimum wage it should not start at $15 per hour but rather be something that is earned through diligent time and training, as many jobs begin. Also if the minimum wage rises it is likely that the prices of daily necessites will go up much like it does when oil prices inflate. Recently, we have see deflations in oil prices but the cost of the average persons necessities has either remained the same or gone up in price. And so, raising the minimum wage may very well cause prices of necessities to rise leaving the person(s) working the minimum wage job(s) in the same position they were in when they were making 6-7.50 per hour. Therefore, I believe the best way to help people who are struggling on what they are making now is to not increase their pay but to encourage and act on making their necessiites affordable again.",2016-01-20T04:22:00Z

I, as a Bernie Sanders supporter who has monetarily donated my li'l measly $250 to his campaign as a working class citizen, just hate that he waited until he got in latter years of his life to run. That being said, we may be seeing another Clinton in The White House unfortunately. And the only thing Martin O'Malley has going for himself is that he's a good looking, polished guy appearance-wise -- otherwise, he's simply a candidate of no concrete substance whatsoever; he seemingly struggles noticeably to answer questions related to policies when posed to him and he tries too hard to win over voters' votes and in debates, inspires to anew and accumulate cheers from the audience.

Dear HUMANITY, the Australian's government is about to
brutally murder 2 millions of feral Cats; (millions of mother Cats and their Kittens)
in the name of saving the wildlife population from extinction. ¬†

¬†

Not only is shooting and
poisoning cats cruel, culls have been shown to be unsuccessful in the long
term. Slaughtering cats to ""manage"" their population can create conditions
that favour accelerated reproduction. The abrupt population decline that
killing animals causes leads to less competition for food among survivors and
ultimately, a higher birth rate, thus leading once more to the very problems
that it claims to solve.

It‚Äôs not Cats who are destroying the environment and
causing extinction, its Humans! The Australia government is not listening to
us! They can spend the same amount of money they plan to spend on murdering the
Cats ,to trap, spay and release them or put them up for adoption. Petition is
not working! HUMANITY, you are the only hope for these doomed Cats. PLEASE DO

I honestly see her as a shape-shifting reptilian who transforms herself and her beliefs the very moment it becomes to her advantage. It disgusts me.

Oh, and it's obvious the people on the panel were in favor of Hillary. They were basically working together with her in an attempt to demonize and destroy Bernie and his credibility.  And in fact, it seems main point of this debate was to capitalize on Hillary's supposed 'strengths' as well as Bernie's supposed 'weaknesses'.",2016-01-19T02:51:03Z

How on earth can anyone think that the idea of everyone having the right to healthcare is an evil, communist scheme? After the cold war, the US seems to have been fixated on non socialist views, because people feel it is somehow unpatriotic to support equality, gun control or healthcare , as socialism is on the same side of the political spectrum as our great enemy communism. Even though I wont be supporting any democrats, i still get annoyed when people accuse them of being ""damn socialist"" or ""communists"" or ""soviets"". If people think what Sanders is doing is communism, then people should seriously take a history or economics lesson, and learn that wanting more equality is a far cry from Soviet Russia or North Korea. People that seriously compare lefties of being communists are just dellusional.",2016-01-19T01:03:42Z

I do however agree it's rude/not true to call democrats any of those things(damn socialist, communists soviets etc.). Bernie however is a self-proclaimed democratic socialist which is more or less the same as a socialist. As far as Bernie being called a communist, his plans aren't as extreme as communism. To get your main point as far as people not understanding the difference between Socialism and communism there is a lot of confusion as to what is or is not an example of communism and socialism. the Nordic countries (Sweden Norway Denmark) are NOT socialists. Many believe them to be so, but even the PM of Denmark has stated that they are not socialists. The fact is there are no real examples of socialism or communism because they have never been able to stay stable without devolving into a dictatorship. Because of this there is no real difference between socialism and communism because they both can't work and end up as a big government monstrosity. To simplify, as i'm not sure that made sense, I think people assume they are exactly the same because  both socialism and communism end as a cruel and wicked government pushing down it's people to the lowest levels of poverty.",2016-01-19T01:25:16Z

Socialism really doesn't work very well at all either like you said, but I stand by my universal healthcare point, which works in many European countries, which as you pointed out, aren't actually socialist countries.  The U.K. for example have a conservative government, but support free tax paid healthcare and are pro choice etc. I don't understand why if you're a republican you are expected to be pro life and expect everyone to have to pay extortionate amounts for healthcare. I think this pure capitalism view and very heavily Christian moral views are a shame, and I still find it hard to believe how many people are actually still religious. I am liking Trump more and more because of this, as even though he says he religious like Obama, I really doubt he's that devoted at all.",2016-01-20T15:42:40Z

Bernie is most popular among the young people of the U.S. He is what they want for president. If he wins, it will be because of high youth turnout. You keep saying that Hillary will accomplish the most for the people as president. It's more than that though, its the ideas that he makes the country aware of. It's about the president after Sanders. It's about clearing Washington of corruption. It's about changing the laws of our country. It's about removing big money as a factor in political races. It's about stopping deals that happen behind closed doors.

You may think that Sanders will be stopped at every turn if elected. I say let it happen, because my generation won't have it.

The problem with such orientations is that they are built out of the fantasies of those who hold them rather than out of any disciplined analysis of reality. Repeating ideological narratives with great conviction doesn't transform them into a more reliable or useful form of information than they are.

2016-01-21T06:42:21Z,@lordjavathe3rd,ti2Nokoq1J4,"Steve Harvey¬†I never claimed to be neutral. I imagine that a neutral being can't muster up a reason to feed himself. You're trying to pass yourself off as a man of reason. I think it's cute that you believe reason looks a certain way and sounds morally grey. What is reason but a series of models that have predictive power over their intended medium. Reason without prediction is abstract and incomplete.

What I mean by abstract is some sense of thought like an intuition or a pattern, which doesn't explicitly have a connection with the intended medium.

Logic is mostly used as a meme which means something like: comprehensive, exact, without holes. However, I see it as a patterned way of thinking, intended to be consistent instead of comprehensive. So that it may be used to describe many different objects in the same language. It's usefulness is tied to the number of things it describes. That way references and relationships between the objects one is being logical about can be consistent.

Hypothetically, if a logic was complete it would have truth, but that isn't the case for humans. We vary with time and our biological state, so not one of us is logical in its pure sense. So when you suggest that you are being logical and I am not, I have good reason to doubt you. Moreover, the complexity, and breadth of your logic is as yet unstated.

So how do we argue? We are in essence talking about potential futures depending on who is elected. Who can guess? You be passionate about yours and I'll be passionate about mine.

Or perhaps you want to talk about something more interesting than politics. I would gladly join you.¬†",2016-01-21T06:42:21Z

That's exactly the same kind of hollow and meaningless rhetorical posturing that Tea Partiers rely on to make their ignorance sound superior in their own ears, as if¬†the pretense creates a reality. There's nothing morally grey about my position; it simply balances an identification o f the ideals to be pursued with the requirements in the real world for realizing them, rather than¬†pretend that idealism divorced of any analysis, divorced of any mobilization of precise knowledge of the systemic realities of the world, existing in an emotionally self-gratifying but utterly impotent vacuum sufficient to¬†create the happy illusion of¬†moral superiority but capable only of being exploited by those¬†less absurd for ends utterly unrelated to those¬†for which they are held in the first place.¬†This has nothing to do with¬† ""impartiality""; it has to do with applying disciplined reason and imagination to the challenges we face, in order to face them most effectively. You arrogate to yourself a pretense of superiority for eschewing such disciplined reason in favor of a cartoonish reduction of reality, which is sufficient to satisfy your needs but insufficient to accomplish anything in the real world.¬†

As for logic, it is what it is, and I teach it. I am (or have been) a sociologist, lawyer, author, teacher, public policy consultant and social analyst who applies methodical analytical reasoning to methodically gathered and verified information in service to a rigorously derived understanding of the dynamical systems in which we are ensconced, for the purpose of navigating those systems to maximum effect in service to our shared humanity. It's really the only rational way to go about this shared endeavor we are engaged in. Now, you want to convince yourself of something else, something fluffier and more appealing to your cognitive modality, have at it. But logical argumentation will never succeed in proving why something other than logic is superior to it, or why some alternative definition of logic that merely rationalizes one's own preferred irrationality is superior to our systemic and historically developed definition of its various forms and branches.

The use of logic does not imply a claim to certainty or infallibility, but recognition of uncertainty and fallibility does not imply any diminution in the value of the use of logic. Indeed, a rational person recognizes that the world is a complex and subtle place and that humans are highly fallible, and incorporates that into their understanding. It is not a pretense of being perfectly logical, but rather an effort to use the best tools of human consciousness to the best advantage to the greatest extent possible and for the most humane and productive purposes possible. Being assiduously rational (which is not to say unimaginative or dispassionate, imagination and passion being corollaries of rather than incompatible with logic) is always preferable to being¬†self-indulgently irrational instead, if one takes seriously the responsibility to humanity that we are both claiming is motivating us in the present instance.
.
I have only skimmed your comments, including this most recent one, but it appears at a glance that you are implying that uncertainty means that arbitrary opinions are indistinguishable in value from more diligently derived ones, or that a vague heuristic methodology is as reliable as a more precisely defined one. I personally think that, while heuristics play a role and can be quite valuable, wherever a question can be subjected to a more rigorous analysis, the understanding of that question and the possible answers to it improves through the effort.

I have a precise analysis of why the glassy-eyed support that some seem to have for Bernie is both irrational and counterproductive. I don't think it helps to achieve the ends that motivate it; in fact, I think it contributes to a greater probability of a lesser movement in the direction of their achievement. I don't think that casually or arbitrarily or because I have some emotional predisposition which motivates me to, but rather because my own careful consideration of available evidence sifted through the organizing process of rational analysis leads me to that conclusion. I can and have written at length in various places exactly what evidence and what rational analysis applied to it leads to that conclusion. And I would certainly respect and entertain a similarly rigorous counterargument, but that is, so far, not what I have encountered. Instead, I encounter various defenses of irrationality and arbitrary belief. I do not believe that they are really quite so defensible.",2016-01-21T18:56:08Z
2016-01-21T22:41:06Z,@steveharvey9069,ti2Nokoq1J4,"Political skills and expertise involves the ability, first, to assess the various probabilities of various outcomes as determined by all of the poltical variables currently in place, including the composition of Congress, the demographic and partisan map of the country (including enough districts gerrymandered to be safely ultra-conservative to block any of the legislation that Bernie favors), the ideological composition of the country and the current zeitgeist, and which variables are in motion in which directions with what possible trajectories depending on what set of factors. That is just a fraction of the complex dynamical reality that must be constantly assessed and reassessed, with empirical and analytical.

Then, one must be able to assess the configurations of interests embedded in that landscape, including the interests of all relevant office holders, the interests of their constituents, the interests of other groups with varying kinds and degrees of political economic, organizational, and cultural power. One must know enough about the other systemic phenomena that intersect that social institutional and technological landscape to understand how policies affect them, sometimes in counterintuitive ways, and how those effects impact the various interests in complex and tangled relationships to one another. Finally, one must be able to engage in a set of bargaining, trading, cajoling, and other strategic interactions to achieve tangible outcomes that best serve the agenda that that individual has ""hitched their star"" to.

The kinds of politicians who the zealots in both parties condemn as tainted and corrupt are frequently those with precisely these skills, to varying degrees. (It is usually more heuristic than how I've presented it, much as a billiards player uses complex physical dynamics embedded in techniques rather than expressed academically). The kinds of politicians who the zealots in both parties embrace as representing the kind of purity they long for are generally, sometimes cynically and sometimes genuinely, the kind who simply don't have those skills and talents but say what those populist factions want to hear and play on their naivete.

Those who promise things through elected office that are not realistically attainable at present through that aspect of our process are not offering a positive change but rather a self-destructive diversion of energy into that which can't be done, and by doing so are sacrificing that which can be done. Those who choose officials solely on the basis of how much they agree with what they say are privileging the cheapest dimension of a complex package over other essential dimensions that are more prosaic but far more necessary.

(On the other hand, Bernie as the leader of a movement working to change the zeitgeist so that, years down the line, we could attain the kinds of policy shifts he favors, would be great. Two useful places where he could do that most effectively is as a social movement leader operating outside the realm of electoral politics, or in a cabinet position, Secretary of Labor, for instance, where his skills and passions would be put to best use.)

I have nothing against Bernie, but the description above of a savvy politician is not at all of him. In fact, the things that his supporters love most about him is the degree to which he is ""above that fray,"" the only problem being that no political ends can be accomplished by being above that fray. Bernie has had a very unspectacular legislative career, because he is much more talented at articulating an intelligent and appealing ideological narrative than at accomplishing anything in the political arena.

It is often said that candidates campaign in poetry and govern in prose. That means that wise voters try to see through the poetry to discover if that candidate also has a particularly deft ability with the more prosaic demands of effective governance. Bernie has not demonstrated any such ability to any great degree.",2016-01-21T22:41:06Z

My approach to voting for Sanders was more along the lines of rambunctious rebellion. According to you, the different cultures within the United States are the real enemy. Voting for Sanders would be like covering the mud with a blanket.¬†

Well, I can't argue with you. Your points are solid. In that case, I'm not interested in voting for a president or anyone in government.

But electoral politics is the most immediate and superficial dimension of political action, while the more essential and fundamental political struggle is a cultural one. It is not necessary, therefore, to eschew electoral politics because it isn't what it isn't, nor to abandon one's deeper ideals because electoral politics isn't the venue in which they can be most directly and uncompromisingly pursued. Rather, we should invest in the necessary and messy and only ever partially successful struggles in the electoral political arena with pragmatism and realistic expectations, and invest in more unfettered and ambitious struggles in the cultural arena.

2016-01-22T01:12:36Z,@lordjavathe3rd,ti2Nokoq1J4,Steve Harvey Why? There is no collective because the differences in culture are too deep between regions. If the enemy is culture then you are fighting time by voting. Who cares? The people of the United States are the enemy. The only right answer is culture alienation and divorce. I'm not about to vote for something that might happen after I die.,2016-01-22T01:12:36Z
2016-01-22T01:37:26Z,@steveharvey9069,ti2Nokoq1J4,"One, the ""enemy"" isn't culture; our shared cognitive landscape is simply the arena in which the real political struggles take place.

Two, everyone thinks they are on the right side of those struggles, and no one ever perfectly is (though some come closer than others), particularly because it IS a complex and subtle world, and a large part of the enterprise we are in is an organic and emergent one subtler than our own individual levels of comprehension.

Three, there is a combination of continuity and discontinuity; the notion of there either being or not being ""a collective"" is a false dichotomy. There is some coherence and some dispersion, some commonalities and some distinctions, along multiple dimensions. It is a throbbing, evolving fractal of shared consciousness that we occupy, each of us a somewhat unique swirl spun of by a coherent systemic whole of which we are¬†a part.

Four, if you believe that you are a part of something larger than yourself, such that it is not just your own self-aggrandizement that you are fighting for, then why would that believe only extend to humans of the present and not to humans of the future? Why not fight for things, some of which will not come to fruition until after you die? Every¬†dedicated¬†soldier for social¬†justice has done so.

We are actors on a stage in a play we are writing together, a play whose tragedies and comedies are very real. Why insist that it be other than that? Why demand from reality something that is not an aspect of reality? Why not, instead, accept the terms of our existence, and exert our individual spirits to maximum effect within that context?",2016-01-22T01:37:26Z

I had for quite a while thought that corporations and groups with influence were taking the country for a joy ride.

Take the¬†net neutrality bill that was in the public consciousness recently. The people called their senators, their representatives, and demanded that they take action to stop it.¬†

Seems to me that the fastest way to change the laws is to make popular technology which benefits from change.

We live in a world where very little research and intellectual thought goes on. We have a lot of paper pushers and re-sellers. I want to live in an advanced culture. I want to see the creation of a more articulate language to replace English. I want to see the beginnings of synthetic intelligence.

The majority of people who leave angry negative comments are not informed. 

1) Canada does not have free 
      Healthcare. 

2)  Canada is slowly dismantling 
      Healthcare.   

3) Canada does not have free 
       tuition for college students.

4) Canada is trying to bust 
      Unions.

I will also vote for Hillary but I don&#39;t talk about it much on social websites because 1 positive comment about Hillary will garner 10+ negative reactions from others. Just explaining my experience, I&#39;m not looking to get into a debate here. To explain some more...

A lot of Dems and Republicans who invest in the stock market don&#39;t like Bernie messing with wall street (basically anyone who plays with their 401k) so they are the type of people who will avoid voting for people like Bernie. These may include your parents or older people in your family, if they are retired with a 401k, and have a lot riding on the stock market doing well. Already this year, because of turbulent times, the average 401k of over ~92k, has lost $7.5k in value. So if your parents or aunties/uncles have a 401k of over 100k, they lost $7.5k just this past month (on paper), and must sit tight and wait for the market to (hopefully) rise. Electing Bernie for President will probably also mean a drop in the value of their retirement funds because his position is to be tough on Wall Street.

A lot of people voting for Hillary also think between her and Bernie, she is more electable (able to take in Moderate votes, Republican votes) because she is not on the extreme like Bernie or Trump are.",2016-01-18T23:41:48Z

The end of the ""industrial economy"" was supposed to be the beginning of the ""information economy"" which means, a lot less work, a lot more pay and all kinds of free benefits. After Bill Clinton we had the money to do it all, free schools, free medicine, free transportation. This was supposed to happen back in 2000. 

People say we gave away our jobs to China. We did! On purpose!. We were supposed to let them do the heavy work and we were supposed to use all the riches we had attained to create a new economy and society. A true, paid for America. 

When you hear that we lost 9 trillion, it's true. We didn't lose it, it was taken from us, but it was there! it still is! We were supposed to be the Microsoft of the world, leading ion all freedoms and medicine and infrastructure and switching to non fossil fuels, all of that. Don't let anyone say we don't have the money, we do. Find the 9 trillion first and bring those who took it to justice. 

And as much as I like Bernie, he'll never be able to do what he wants to do. Hillary (and Bill) can, because they are part of the ""system"", they are respected by the ""system"" and they are somewhat on our side too. Just like Obama they know how to walk that fine line to get things done. They know that if they push too much or too hard, the system won't allow them to do anything. This is what we need, just until we make up the 9 trillion. Anyone even thinking of voting republican are either blind, stupid or part of the anti-American changes they want.

Our team won the debate. Moderators included hospital executives, insurance company managers, and health care administration faculty. I've now worked in both mental health and now work for the leading hospital in Orange County/Newport Beach. Private insurance companies will always pass the price of healthcare off the the consumer in the form of higher co-pays, deductibles, and prescription drug costs.

My concern is that the Republican party wants to put EVERYTHING out on the open market and up to the highest bidder.  When this happens, prices just continue to rise and rise with only rich people able to afford them.  How would it be if only those who are able to pay a fee are able to use the highways?  When the electric industry was deregulated the prices of electricity skyrocketed.  Historically, this is what has happened and will continue to happen if you leave everything up to capitalism.

They are supporting him because they are in massive student loan debts, they can't get work, even after getting their degrees. They can't purchase a home. If they do get a job, they have to work longer and harder w/ little or no retirement. What you don't understand sir is that capitalism CANNOT work for everyone. It will ONLY work for a very very few amount of people. Have you ever played monopoly? What happens at the end? NO ONE believes in capitalism, this is a all propaganda placed on the unwitting. Not even big banks believe in capitalism. And the fact is, if you really can't understand this, is we are  neither socialist nor capitalist. We are a hybrid of each. So do yourself, and everyone in the US a favor, and stop regurgitating your hyperbolic statements and propaganda. The truth is somewhere in the middle here. We are a country of people in a great nation who need to share resources and work together in order to thrive and improve. And we can't do that if you continue to be propagandized by the very few who couldn't even spend all the money they had right now in 10 lifetimes if they tried. Get with the program, and realize you may be very very wrong in your positions. There's a much better way than this present course, and it doesn't involve purely capitalistic models, or purely socialist ones. There's a way to do this that involves some of each.",2016-01-20T21:09:53Z

Historically, the middle is only viable when the nation is at peak stability-from foreign to national policy. Nations like Canada (where I'm from) prosper more with the middle (regardless of having a liberal government, we consider them the middle of the spectrum). Another example would be Europe. As europe's economy slides, people begin to vote away from the middle and this historically does better as more dramatic changes need to be put in place. There's no balancing a scale that's tipping to one side by placing a block in the middle.
Right now, from what I see the US really needs some social reform and as the rich get richer, a system to redistribute the wealth to a certain degree. No family needs multiple billions of dollars.",2016-01-21T02:25:17Z

as to your fear-mongering, make an effort to educate yourself on a global scale. many democratic socialist countries stand side by side with the U.S. economically, but stand far above on quality of life, general satisfaction, child mortality rates and poverty rates, and they pay less for the needs of the people such as healthcare. you are afraid, and i don't blame you if it is because of ignorance, but deciding to plug your ears to the world beyond what you know will be your fault from here on. i do not believe we can have a legitimate discussion, but i still await your reply. until then, i leave you with this quote from MLK Jr.: ""This country has socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor.""",2016-01-19T02:08:43Z

First off save the personal attacks man, I have a successful career in the US Army and you don't know how much time I spend on the internet so don't try and act like you do.

Sanders has risen from a no name candidate because of his refreshing and exciting ideas and campaign strategy.

Is it fair to the employer who must now pay more than what ¬†he is receiving from the labor of his employees? Is it fair to the workers who are fired because the boss won't accept the of loss of revenue in order to keep his business which is essential to the market afloat? Is it fair to the consumers who may have to pay more for the goods being produced? Is it fair to the taxpayers who must now subsidize people that were laid off? It's extremely basic.¬†

In terms of college, student loans are already in place in order to make college affordable, however, that the very reason college is so ungodly affordable. When the government provides financial aide for college, tuition cost get raised to a new equilibrium.

Please tell me Why on earth would you vote for Hillary? 
There is absolutely no reason too. Anything she would fight for in office, Bernie Sanders also supports, and he isn't bought, or influenced in any way by the corporations, billionaires, or wall street.  
Hillary may be a democrat, but she has very few individual campaign donations, She gets the lions share of her money from corporations and there is a reason for that. 
Therefore, she, like every president in history, will either be significantly slowed down, or completely controlled by the billionaires and things would be same old same old. 
Please, if you care about fixing america like I'm sure you want to, please reconsider your support and help Sanders, I didn't even follow politics until Bernie came along because I recognized he is something fundamentally different from the gridlock we have been having, and I hope you soon realize that.

2016-01-20T06:38:58Z,@tenaciousb4731,ti2Nokoq1J4,"Alexander Smith With full respect, I agree with you¬†on everything you said about Sen Sanders. His fundamental change proposals are worthwhile as well as what this country needs. I believe no one in this country cares more about American equality than the Senator, as well as truly loving his nation.

However, some of the accusations about Hillary being a moderate (example:small connections to Big Business) are unfortunately her greatest strengths at accomplishing goals (which I agree, are less ambitious than Sen. Sanders)¬†for the Left. I feel Sen. Sanders's goals are so strong, that it will force the all¬†Republicans to dead lock us on all legislation across the country, further dividing our country. This is were Hillary excels: at pushing bi-partisan legislation. She can be a ruthless figure¬†to Conservative congressmen. I feel she has the resources to get more done for the Center and Left.

That being said, if Sen. Sanders gets the nomination (and if he does, I'll support him in every way I can)¬†and defeats Trump, I do believe he may have a chance to complete his new Medicaid & Medicare plan , but I think the Repubs will give HEAVY resistance¬†and block¬†the minimum wage and his other social-economic reforms.

Trust me when I say this, this¬†was not a easy decision to make. And for the record, everything I said is opinion and speculation on my part. On issues of voting for our nations leaders, you have to follow your instincts. For the Democratic nomination, mine tells me to go with Secretary Clinton.

I think there was a comment that got flagged as spam. Said something about try living off of $9 bucks an hour in a city with 2,000 dollar rent. My response is: why the heck are you trying to live on your own on $9 bucks an hour? I realize there's a certain lure to being independent, but I think a lot of people make poor financial choices in this country. And on top of that, people have to start planning ahead. Get an education, learn a trade, get a job that pays more than the minimum wage. A CDL for instance will land you jobs that pay 21 something an hour (in Nebraska).¬†
And I get it, it sucks to have to still live with family when you're 21, 22, etc. I moved out into my own apartment when I was 20, was barely able to save any money, and as soon as my lease was up, I moved back in with family. At least until I finish school and have a steady job and have a good sized checkings/savings account. I don't enjoy living with family, but its necessary.¬†",2016-01-18T21:05:53Z

2016-01-18T21:33:27Z,@JStankXPlays,ti2Nokoq1J4,"+kw bmn The truth of the matter is, that if you make less than 15 dollars an hour your going to support Bernie Sanders, and if you make more than 15 dollars an hour you are going to find it appealing, because your wage will decrease relative to the minimum wage. The math problem that America has to solve today is how do you come up with a wage system whereby a person who works 40 hours a week can afford rent, food, and health care as a minimum standard of living. I believe that if you work 40 hours a week you should be able to afford an efficiency apartment, be able to put food on the table, and be able to go to the doctor when your sick, or not be hurdled into debt if you get injured. I believe that is a fair situation. I'm not saying that these people can drive the fanciest car, or eat out at all the time, and have a big house. I'm saying that they should be able to live to a minimum standard that should be the right of any full time american worker. I understand the complication but Corporate America is going to have to take a few percentage points to their stock price to accomplish this goal. That is all it is. These companies are making huge profits, and to remain relevant to their investors they have to show growth every year. It is not enough for them just to make a profit. They do this by cutting wages to increase their stock price a few percentages each year. This is not only wrong but criminal. If you are working 40 hours a week you should be able to live reasonably. Therefore I support the 15 dollar minimum wage despite its economic challenges.",2016-01-18T21:33:27Z

I see so many foreigners coming from across the world that have these social benefits of free college tuition and healthcare and higher min. wages visiting/coming to the U.S. to shop because everything here is so dirt cheap compared to the prices in their own countries. These social programs that Bernie Sanders is offering, assuming it even makes it past Republican bickering, would just crash and burn into astronomical inflation, higher prices, higher taxes, and various fees added on to aspects of everyday life. Billionaires and corporations can't pay for everything and $15/HR. is waaaay to high of a bump for min. wage. If it was anywhere up to maybe $10.50/hr. I could maybe see it happening.

The economic structures that are already in place won't be affected (unless they're scams) so it's not like the economy will randomely collapse.

(why I assumed you were American, well You fit my own personal stereotype of an American. This is not a valid reason, I know. And you know this is the U.S. debate (I am watching it too and I'm Saxon so that doesn't really count.) And mostly because you used a Hitler comparison which is argument so bad I've seen any Europeans use it, In real life that is)¬†
Your last statement..... I don't even know were to begin.
I don't really have time for this anyway so I'll make my point very briefly:

Slavery is unpaid work, often in unsafe conditions.

What is the incentive for a company (or the CEO) to treat its employees the way it does?
Profit. (this is the goal of the CEO/ owner who has the most leverage in the company)
In what way can the company (mainly the CEO) maximize its profits? By paying its employees as little as possible, and if safety is involved spend as little as they can permit on that. ¬†(This wage still has to be attractive enough for some people to be willing to work for it. and it has to comply with legal boundaries)

Now what is the incentive for a fully democratic state (the employees run the system) with a fully nationalized economy to treat its citizens the way it might do?
To attain the highest possible quality of life within a sustainable system. (that is to say to earn as much as they can without the economy grinding to a halt)

In which system do you think employees are safer and earn more?

""Are you under the impression that the poor work as hard as the rich and the rich just steal?""

Wel sometimes that is the case and sometimes it isn't , Some people work 3 or 4 (sometimes even 5) jobs and still don't earn enough to feed their families. Some rich people just go to one or two events a year and earn 600000 euros a year.

What my justification is for seizing the wealth of the Super rich. (talking about 0.1% of the population here.) Money/wealth is a means of exchange, It's a way to get people to do things for you. To a certain degree it's power materialized into an actual substance. I don't think We should allow people (individuals) to gain enough wealth to threat the proper functioning of the democratic state, Just as I wouldn't allow people to have private armies.(which are in effect power materialized in a different way.)¬†

To make an anology,
In a world where there is no army owned by the state (present, like in medieval times the army served to protect the nation against groups of bandits but there wasn't a police force so small groups of criminals could go unnoticed) and an imminent threat (disease, hunger, thirst, stuff like that). ¬†I consider it to be justifiable to have an army that is large enough for self defence (enough money to live a comfortable and fun life), and relative security But I don't consider it to be justifyable to have an army large enough to endanger thae state itself or to use the army (power/wealth) to influence the desicion making of a democratic society. especially not if you took large parts of your personal army from the self defence forces of other individuals, And it's even worse (IMO) if you then use your army to rob the peole that now are insufficiently capable of defending themselves. ¬†
Has this analogy^ clarified my position?

Edit: Depending on who you ask there's anywhere between 195 and 207 countries.",2016-01-20T21:49:59Z

Obama healthcare is part of the Wall Street structure and why Hillary defends it so adamantly.  It's healthcare for profit through the big insurance and pharmaceutical companies. Our nation wants to make money off the sick, that system does not work. For profit healthcare should be completely dismantled and we must begin to service the sick AT COST - AND NOT INFLATED COSTS AS PROFIT. That is why Bernie can quote a triple cost of healthcare over the other industrialized nations. 

The wealthy in America have INVADED healthcare and merely set up many systems to get paid. When you get sick, the rich are getting richer, through inflated pricing. When you pay your monthly healthcare premium, the rich are getting richer. Even those higher deductibles that state insurance companies do not have to kick in money for your health, the rich are getting richer. The wealthy have very little respect for us everyday humans.",2016-01-18T18:23:03Z

We currently are a little too capitalistic, which is why we are trying to push for some more socialistic policies with Bernie. If you have only capitalism, you will end up with huge corruption and an effective oligarchy (pretty much where we are, or where we're headed). We need at least some socialism to mitigate exploitation of rich and powerful people, or else the prospect of America's greatness, that anyone can make a good life for themselves, really is not true. 

If you would only have a few super wealthy people and no socialistic protections for lower-class workers, the more rich and powerful would dominate them based on what they want, and, at least in a republic, that is a huge issue. If we were a more absolute democracy, then capitalism would work much better without any required socialism because the people wouldn't be (easily) bought by big money interests, and the power of each person's vote would regulate these exploitation¬†issues any way, and probably lead to some socialistic policies.

2016-01-18T21:06:27Z,@JStankXPlays,ti2Nokoq1J4,"+Tiffany Abney The truth of the matter is, that if you make less than 15 dollars an hour your going to support Bernie Sanders, and if you make more than 15 dollars an hour you are going to find it appealing, because your wage will decrease relative to the minimum wage. The math problem that America has to solve today is how do you come up with a wage system whereby a person who works 40 hours a week can afford rent, food, and health care as a minimum standard of living. I believe that if you work 40 hours a week you should be able to afford an efficiency apartment, be able to put food on the table, and be able to go to the doctor when your sick, or not be hurdled into debt if you get injured. I believe that is a fair situation. I'm not saying that these people can drive the fanciest car, or eat out at all the time, and have a big house. I'm saying that they should be able to live to a minimum standard that should be the right of any full time american worker. I understand the complication but Corporate America is going to have to take a few percentage points to their stock price to accomplish this goal. That is all it is. These companies are making huge profits, and to remain relevant to their investors they have to show growth every year. It is not enough for them just to make a profit. They do this by cutting wages to increase their stock price a few percentages each year. This is not only wrong but criminal. If you are working 40 hours a week you should be able to live reasonably. Therefore I support the 15 dollar minimum wage despite its economic challenges.",2016-01-18T21:06:27Z

There are problems with companies paying min wage when they should not be and I recognize this. But for jobs that offer high school kids (such as restaurants and convenient stores) jobs that could be done by other means, min wage is acceptable. As I said. I do understand that companies need to be relegated when it comes to paying min wage for work that requires skill, but flipping a burger, scanning items, etc, do not. Machines could easily take the place of those employees. Raising the minimum wage to $15 not only 1. will raise the cost of everything else. 2. will cause jobs to be lost due to the companies inability to continue paying their employees and 3. will be a slap in the face to those currently making that who have worked for it.¬†",2016-01-19T19:03:37Z

She's cozying up to him now literally just for the free support it gets her, plus it's an easy out to almost any attack Bernie can throw at her. ""He questions my healthcare plan? I'mma follow Obama's footsteps. He questions my foreign policy? I'm just gonna do more of what Obama's doing."" Easy pivot and free brownie points with minimal actual effort.
She can't attack Bernie over his lack of experience, or any of his actual policies, so here she is now flat out lying about his healthcare plan on national TV during a debate that SHE KNOWS is going to end up in its entirety online (it's sponsored by Youtube for Christ's sake). And not only did she lie, but she had Chelsea come out and do it first, presumably trying to bait Bernie into attacking Chelsea.
She attacked Obama over using what she called 'Republican tactics' in 08 when he attacked her over healthcare, and now she's using them herself, attacking Bernie over his healthcare plan. She's fully aware that Bernie's policies will win the war of ideas, so she's smearing him and trying to tarnish his chances through thinly-veiled lies and attacks on his near-unblemished record. Hillary herself used to be for universal healthcare. She fought for it for nearly two decades. Now she's attacking Bernie because he wants it. She wasn't for gay marriage twenty years ago, when public opinion was anti-gay. Now public opinion has swapped sides, and so has he. She agreed with Bill on removing Glass-Steagall. She voted for the war in Iraq, and regime change in Libya, and she wants to do it in Syria too. Bernie has always been for universal healthcare. Bernie has always been for gay rights. Bernie voted against repealing Glass-Steagall. Bernie voted against the Iraq war. Bernie isn't sure if regime change is the right answer.
¬†Every one of Hillary's actions seems to be a mean to the same end: getting elected. She changes her answers based on what people want to hear. Hell, the woman even adds a drawl to her voice when she's campaigning in the south. She wants to be the first woman president. That's her sole motivation for running. Bernie wants to fix a system that's rigged to feed the rich instead of the working man.
And you talk about her becoming Secretary of State like Hillary got to choose to be it. Obama appointed her as a show of faith within the party, and she accepted. Of course she did. It's a position that gets her closer to the presidency and makes her more influential, so why wouldn't she?
So she gets points for being loyal to her party? Why? Why should I give a damn if she's loyal to her party? Her party doesn't share my interests, they share their donors' interests.",2016-01-20T07:55:26Z

I was actually unaware that a dimebag could refer to weed until after I made this handle and friends raised their eyebrows at me. My handle is referring to a guitarist from one of my favorite bands, 'Dimebag' Darrell Abbott, who was tragically shot and killed on stage by a mentally-ill fan after starting anew after said band broke up, as well as a friend I lost to suicide who's nickname was Dime, shortly after she helped me through my bout with suicidal-depression..
Now that I've told you my life story, let's get back to the actual point
Bernie's plan is a good plan, and you're simply wrong if you think otherwise (presumably because you're misinformed). It will provide healthcare for all Americans while saving middle class families an average of $5000 annually (according to Bernie's campaign) and the country as a whole an estimated $5 trillion annually (according to economists). As for getting it passed, the way we get that done is by voting in a Democratic congress, and getting them to pass campaign finance reform.
Bernie isn't the answer, nor does he claim to be. Bernie is the catalyst to getting us there. He knows just as well as everyone else that it will take more than just electing him to get these things done. That's why his biggest priority is campaign finance reform; so Congress is no longer beholden to these private organizations.¬†
And let's be perfectly frank here; If we can't get universal healthcare,or campaign finance reform, or tuition-free college passed under Bernie, we will never get it passed. It will not happen until we elect someone who isn't beholden to any of those corporations or lobbyist groups. That someone is Bernie, and he's the only someone we have for the foreseeable future.
I want universal healthcare. I want campaign finance reform. I want tuition-free college, and the ending of the drug war, and higher marginal tax rates on the rich and the breaking up of the too-big-to-fail financial institutions, so I'm voting for Bernie. I honestly don't care if it's unrealistic (even though it isn't, it's been done in basically every developed democracy that isn't here). I'm not going to settle for watered-down change when offered the real thing, and neither should you.",2016-01-20T08:41:27Z

¬† ¬†Most Americans don't fly 'right' or 'left' and have separate beliefs on a whole host of issues. Many Republicans Don't care about abortion and think it should be legal, although they don't want planned parenthood using tax money to 'give' abortions (which I don't even thing that's the case). While most Democrats are fine with guns, but just want to close loop holes and have background checks/psycho analyst done on those with a license to carry. Both of these things are supported by a majority of America, but misinformation leads people astray.
¬† Both parties has multiple groups within them, but can't pass anything without the entire group acting as a whole. This is what makes government clumsy. The Republicans have the Tea Party members and the Demos have the Warren Wing/ Progressives. While both are still controlled by only one true leading body with the ability to still accomplish something, I'm talking about the wealthy people buying out politicians.

I think in some ways our politics being bought out might be a good thing being that we might not be able to pass any legislation without someone holding the rains. However I'm more interested in shaking it up a bit and kicking them out of total power. ¬† ¬† ¬†",2016-01-23T05:07:45Z
2016-01-23T08:21:53Z,@WeMissDimebag,ti2Nokoq1J4,"jesse spence¬†America as a whole are actually much farther left than the media will ever tell you. Most people are in favor of expanding social security, of universal background checks, of universal healthcare and universal education. These things poll at 70+% among Americans.
The reason these things have never happened, and won't ever happen as long as the politicians are corporately owned, is because all these things go against the corporate interest, as well as the public generally not being very involved in politics. Half the country comes out, votes for President, then goes home and just crosses their fingers and prays, largely because most people have lost all faith in the system at this point, and because they're simply misinformed (a lot of people think Bernie's policies are impossible without huge tax hikes. Spoiler alert: Most people will only see something like a 6% change, and won't see any further taxation). What we need to do, in my view, is to get the money out, and motivate people to come out and rally and support all these policies until the right gets the message that most of the American public fundamentally does not agree with them.",2016-01-23T08:21:53Z

These things are what keep people from agreeing with their party, but also what keeps the conversation from moving.

I'm just wondering what will happen and how long will it take after said marriage is broken between private business and public policy to see any real change or positive gain. ¬† ¬†

I think its needed but I can see the value in a handful of people actually trying to lead this country. Democracy is a good ideal until nothing gets passed the floor of squabbles and debate. This is when someone of real power can influence change be they dictator or donor.

It's when you get highly polarized political parties that can't even agree that some economic policies don't work that it starts to fail."" This fact is only true or relevant in the examples you give. I think the issue I see with this statement is that it falls on it's face when talking about the first term of Obama's Presidency. They had a super majority and didn't pass nearly enough legislation.
However you avoided the major point I was making in the first place. How long and what are the effects of public financing of campaigns. I think to say there is no negatives is too be naive and to say that it would wreak the country just as silly. I don't know how they would enforce those laws being they hardly enforced them before and I don't have a complete understanding of all the pro's and con's. I think an obvious con to such an event would be the simple stagnation of politicians being that they ether can't make the money to put out adds or run under the same flag.

2016-01-24T04:30:54Z,@WeMissDimebag,ti2Nokoq1J4,"Well it's simply true that most democracies don't have such issues. Look at all of Europe. Look up Britain's political system especially, for example. It's virtually impossible for them to meet an impasse.
President Obama's first term didn't accomplish anything because the president was too busy trying to negotiate with the right in hopes he would still be able to negotiate once he lost the majority, compounded with, again, conflict of interests with corporate donors.
That said, he could've bullied legislation through and didn't. It's perhaps the greatest failure of his presidency.
Public-funded campaigns would probably mean you'd be fairly limited in how many candidates could run for either party. You couldn't have 14 Republican candidates fracturing up their base and expect any except maybe the top 3 to be able to run large TV ad campaigns.
But that's not really a bad thing, a) because the reason they can't run those adds is because they don't have support of the people, and b) because we have the internet now. You don't have to run a ton of TV ads. Look at Bernie Sanders. He's on equal footing with Hillary almost, and his campaign has been almost exclusively via the internet and public rallies. He still has money to run TV ads, in fact, he just released a new one for Iowa and New Hampshire, but he didn't need to run ads to get attention. Furthermore, the reason we have news media is in part to give these people platforms to spread their ideas. Let the news outlets and the parties themselves help spread their messages, along with the people, not the corporation spreading them without any involvement of the people.
It's also worth saying that we wouldn't necessarily have to implement laws to stop corporate-owned elections. We'd more than likely try and ratify a constitutional amendment. That's what Bernie and WOLF-PAC are aiming for. Bernie obviously hasn't specifically said so because he doesn't want people quoting him that he's gonna get an amendment passed, it's just that that's the optimal scenario.",2016-01-24T04:30:54Z

The myth is that it is the insurance companies are the ones who are screwing people over. That is not true, it is the PROVIDERS. The pharmaceutical industry are in league with the doctors to keep Americans hooked on designer drugs and the prices of those drugs are WAY more than the cost is to produce them. There needs to be close regulation on HOW MUCH we pay for pills, services, and medical devices.

I assume health insurance companies need a large pool of insured customers in order to mitigate risk and stay profitable. That helps health insurance companies to have virtual monopolies in some markets, which allows them to inflate prices above market value. The result is that the companies make massive profits and the rich fill their pockets but the middle class consumer gets ripped off. Some buyers will be priced out entirely.

I could be wrong though. I'm not an expert on the economics of health care. I'm just trying to understand what's going on based on bits and pieces of information that I've picked up here and there.",2016-01-22T00:03:35Z

The Klan wears it as a symbol for hate pride in their misguided thoughts of supremacy. Some people wear it as a symbol of heritage to represent where they came from. The flag is a piece of colored cloth. It's meaning lies with the people who bear it at any given time. Hope,  triumph, hatred, heritage. It all depends on us. So to disregard someone's opinion for sake of a colored cloth is the type of idiocy that divides the country as it is today.

Seriously? Create jobs? I've always heard this acclamation that the rich and powerful in this create jobs and not say... the mom and pop stores that start up, local businesses that just opened or say, the government with how it creates jobs through manufacturing projects and adding areas to expand the city. But no, the rich and powerful are the ones that create jobs, despite them constantly downsizing their personal so they can save money, despite them consistently advocating that they be allowed to ship jobs overseas and sell the products they create here, despite the fact that the biggest environmentalist disaster in recent memory has destroyed the east coast fishing industry,  despite the fact that their factory farms often come at a cost of displacing local farmers who sell their goods locally and despite mega stores like Wal-Mart coming into a town and forcing all the competition to close their doors because they can no longer compete... somehow the rich and powerful are the ones creating jobs and the government is the one destroying it?

Maybe if politicians would open their eyes and see that they should put the people before the corporations who are ROBBING us of decent lives, ROBBING us of the ability in our future,  and ROBBING us of the progress that we are making as a country, then the country would benefit. Corporations are no longer providing us with jobs. They are sending jobs overseas that belittle the workers of countries like China, Bangladesh, India, etc... They are sending jobs overseas to countries with little to no labor standards so that they can exploit a broken system to make a profit.
Bernie wants to tax the wealthy because they aren't paying their taxes now! We pay our taxes and who does it benefit? Them! The corporations have bribed the government so thoroughly that our taxes no longer benefit those who are paying them, but those who already have enough money to pay for things that the common man struggles to pay for. 
You're using the term ""socialist"" and painting it as something so thoroughly negative. I am a socialist and I am proud to be a socialist, for at least I care about the good of 100% of the people and not just the top 1%. I am proud  to be a socialist because I do not look at the world through blinders.

It allows freedom of choice opportunities. Capitalism does work in this country it is a system that allows everyone to have opportunities unlike Capitalism during the industrial revolution when workers and labors had no rights and children were forced to work getting paid only the bear minimum. Nowadays people may not be equal financially, but they do have the opportunities to become wealthy if they work hard and they can afford food,shelter, clothing and a free education. Socialism makes everyone unable to advance themselves within society.Everyone may be equal ,but people will depend completely on the government for everything. Governments will take advantage of people and take away the freedoms for the sake of ""safety"" and ""equality"".

Also, ask any Canadian just how great their health care system is. On paper it sounds so great but the reality is that the government has no interest in your well being only its survival. Desperate people wait too long for medical attention when time is of the utmost importance. It's tragically incompetent.

Ask students and parents in Harlem just how awesome their new charter schools are. Dramatic improvements over their state funded public schools. Main reason: The ability to fire poorly performing teachers.

Free Market is the only answer. It's proven time and time again. Let the consumers make the decisions with their wallets; not a bunch of incompetent bureaucrats with nothing to lose or incentive to do a decent job.

They dont even have to maintain a big military to keep world peace like the US. Massive debt, sky high taxes, sky high gas prices, declining population, small military and STILL failing.
And then theres my personal experience that ALL of the hardcore socialists Ive talked to in the past few years admitted that the only reason they support socialism is because it leads to communism.

2016-01-18T17:35:19Z,,ti2Nokoq1J4,"""The GOP-authored bill was crafted as a response to a proposal from ex-Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Brooksley Born to ramp up oversight of derivatives. But the version Sanders initially voted for was more benign than the final, Gramm-authored version, and it didn't draw any of the protests that the 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagall did. In October 2000, the bill passed the House by a vote of 377 to 4 (51 members didn't vote), and then sat on the shelf for weeks.

But in December, Gramm -- after¬†coordinating¬†with top Clinton administration officials -- added much harder-edged deregulatory language to the bill, then attached the entire package to a must-pass 11,000-page bill funding the entire federal government. After Gramm's workshopping, the legislation included new language saying the federal government ""shall not exercise regulatory authority with respect to, a covered swap agreement offered, entered into, or provided by a bank."" That ended all government oversight of derivatives purchased or traded by banks. He also created the so-called ""Enron Loophole,"" which barred federal oversight of energy trading on electronic platforms.

Sanders has since hammered the CFMA, its architects and specific provisions in Senate hearings and on the Senate floor. He helped push through legislation to close the Enron loophole in 2008. He voted against the bank bailouts of 2008, and has¬†cried foul¬†on heavy Wall Street speculation in the derivatives market for oil, saying it needlessly drives up gas prices. He has voted to break up the largest banks, and supports reinstating the Depression-era firewall between conventional lending and risky securities trading.""

No I mean a bought congress- they have a 13% approval rate and yet they have a 90% reelection rate mostly due to big money in the process which excludes real democracy- middle class candidates from running.  

The ACA is basically Romney Care.  It is a the result of the Heritage Foundation counter to Hilarycare from the 90s which Bob Dole ran with.  It is a massive handout to insurance companies, and Bernie's position is the best to make a public option and stop the handouts to the insurance companies which is creating an inflation in prices.  Also Bernie is an example of someone who is not bought- who fights the good fight.

2016-01-19T13:58:41Z,@JamesOGant,ti2Nokoq1J4,"The real problem is economic neoliberalism and liberalism in the US which hijacks any party it can find- both major parties and candidates represent these economic policies.  These are ideas that really should have died in the late 1800s, but they found a new following in the late 70s because many politicians started turning to demagoguery and social darwinism and Just World Fallacy type rhetoric to get elected.  It essentially is sort of a soft corporate fascism.  

Economic neoliberalism is the economic philosophy that the government should not tax the super rich and corporations much, and that it should also hand out massive amounts of money to the rich and those same corporations.  They all now have either moved overseas and or practice profit models that depend upon this kind of market CONTROL.  

Ironically these same people fund the media sources that tell the tale of the ""free market""- never mind the fact that their very business models are dependent upon government handouts, market controls in their favor, and cronyism.  For example the fossil fuels industry gets about 5.3 trillion dollars a year in government subsidy from world governments.  This is more than ALL past yearly US government revenues, and it is about 1/3 of the entire US GDP.

Meanwhile as the government takes in less revenues the public sector takes all the cuts decade after decade.  The very same public sector that is mostly responsible for the lion's share of advancements in science and technology.   So this is why really the right and the left both have politicians that are bought and are out to serve the moneyed interests.   

So there is NO perfect solution, but Bernie is the best solution because he will go back to a more traditional sustainable tax and investment plan and more traditional economic planning by way of investing in the public sector and private contracts to drive up employment and wages at the local and state levels thereby driving up wage based consumerism which is what should ideally drive small businesses etc.  

I mean Bernie is the only candidate that has promised NOT to put someone from a big bank as the national secretary of the treasury.  

If you look at FDR and Eisenhower, epitome left and right politicians from the 1950s and earlier- both of them taxed the rich and reinvested the money back into the public sector and private contracting.   Thereby creating a more sustainable hyperinflation cycle- one that feeds common prosperity not just the prosperity of the top 5%.

Currently we have another kind of hyper inflation cycle which is called a ""vicious cycle""- it basically siphons most of the money to the top and leads to the lessening of the qualities of life for most while enriching a few using government controls.  In the long run it is bad for everyone involved.

Beyond this we have to reestablish JUSTICE in the US.  Those bankers that intentionally caused the crash should all be put in jail and or be put to working on a more sustainable way of making profits.  And the justice system needs to be redesigned to stop putting so many americans in jail for minor possession, and those people should be put to work by way of investing in the working class in the public and private contracting sector.

Because so far, we haven't had a solid layout accessible to the average voter to see.

It's not ""control"" necessarily over healthcare as much as it is democratically and duly well planned healthcare administered by the government.  Similar to how public education is administered, Bernie's idea is basically just an expansion of medicare.   Which would effectively change the major part of the ACA, the part that republicans and fox news have given a lot of talking time to- which was the mandate- which forced people to buy insurance through the market place or pay a tax.  

With his plan you just are covered by medicare if you are a US citizen.  Then the government uses its bargaining power to keep prices at the same levels they are at in other contemporary countries- like everywhere else they pay less for pharmaceuticals because they know how much it costs to produce said drug at all levels and how much they think is a fair profit- then offer, counter offer, offer etc.  This is bargaining.

There is a lot of rhetoric about ""control"" and ""government getting out of the way"", and while everyone is for a more sustainable efficient cost effective government - the government is supposed to ideally be a democratic representative republic- in the way that the government is ""of the people by the people for the people."" 

And there are few necessities for any viable sovereign nation- one of which is justice at all levels of society, from already made laws to enforcement of those laws to the design of laws.  There is a lot of false choice going around about how we cannot have justice because the government is this tyrannical force that imposes its will on the people as if it is not the people.  That assumption then leading to the selffulfilling prophecy of the lack of democracy and we get people like those in Oregon that do not see the US government as their government.

But again Bernie has not taken any money from big business or banks or super pacs.  He is rare but if the people demand the change in finance reform we would likely see a change in the priorities of congress - who now mostly serve the status quo and the super rich.",2016-01-19T23:57:21Z

That's not even half the country though. The federal government is corrupt, that's a given. The majority of the people are desperate for change, but fear another armed revolution. The wounds from 1910 are still felt in society. The fact that you lived in TX and had Mexican friends means nothing if you didn't cross the border and lived in Mexico yourself. Your claim is a valid as me saying that almost all Texans are gun toting reactionaries who ejaculate every time Greg Abbott's wheelchair wheels squeak. Sure, there are some center-left people in Austin and Houston, but they're easily outnumbered and threatened if they speak out. I currently live in TX, so my words hold some water too. Ridiculous, no? By the way, MS13 isn't a Mexican gang, it's Salvadoran. But I'll let that one slide. After all, Americans and Canadians are the same, right? /s",2016-01-19T22:12:00Z

2016-01-20T20:49:20Z,@owlman_,ti2Nokoq1J4,"I didn't say you categorized all of Mexico, you said ""pretty much all..."" and I took that as ""most"". If I'm wrong, correct me.

MS13 actually originated by Salvadorans in LA, so I suppose it's a Salvadoran-American gang by that technicality. Nowadays there are Mexicans in MS13, yes, but it's still largely composed and run by Salvadorans. MS13 works with some Mexican cartels, but they aren't affiliated, as MS13 specializes in human trafficking. Another thing, there is no ""Mexican mafia"". It's not united. That's exactly what the Mexican and American governments are trying to prevent.¬†I know you said you understand Trump's point of view. I can understand it too, anyone can, but he is wrong, period.

The Mexican government extradites some of its prisoners at the *request* of the US, it doesn't do it on a whim or for the hell of it. In order for a prisoner to extradited here, they need to break the law in this country and a formal legal process must be followed. In Guzman Loera's case, Mexico refused to extradite him both times he was taken into custody. This time, they agreed, as having to arrest him twice during the same administration is yet another embarrassment for the Mexican government. The Mexican government isn't extraditing out of pride that Guzman Loera was caught, it's out of shame and international public ridicule. The process is expected to take 1-2 years though. Of course the media are still talking about him. He's been Mexico's number-one wanted terrorist for about 20 years.¬†",2016-01-20T20:49:20Z

All of these candidates are way too left. If you are 18-24 and are currently working, even if it is a minimum wage job, there is about a 50% chance that you will lose that job if one of the candidates on this stage get elected. If I was a small business owner, like a local restaurant, and I had to all of a sudden had to pay my employees double, one of two things would happen. Either I would raise my prices and risk losing business and possibly shutting down, or laying off approximately half of my staff and hope that the half that I keep are good enough to keep my business up and running. I have made it through college and am working as an engineer. My wife is a stay at home mom because it doesn't make financial sense to have our daughter in day care. So we are a family of four living on a single income. If these wages go up, you could have a young couple, who didn't graduate high school, flipping burgers at McDonalds, with a higher household wage than we have. The entire Democratic platform is about equality, especially income equality. How is this equal? How does the person that put his money and time into getting a higher education, all of a sudden penalized because of a class of 18-24 year olds who think things should be given to them instead of working for them. Instead of jacking up the minimum wage, how about we improve the subsidies for day care facilities so working moms and dads can have a place to take their children so they can continue to work to improve their lives. We have to stop treating service industry jobs as careers.¬†I should never see someone older than 30 working at a fast food place. Those are jobs you get when you are in high school, or to help pay your way through college. They are jobs you grow out of. I'm worried that increasing minimum wage will just make it more convenient for people to be stagnant.

She does this with many issues just defending Obama's legislations as the pinnacle when there's so much room for progress. 
Anti-Bernie people label him as weak, however he's fighting for something better than the status quo - the one trying to settle for 2nd best seems to be Hilary on many issues.
Why? There's more money for the establishment and private sector with the 2nd best option.

Mainstream Media has just as much influence as the corrupt Campaign Finance System. Though, their sway is slowly dwindling, thankfully. We should create a State-run news agency for circumstances just such as these: electoral debates and political speeches, so that they can be presented to the American people in an unbiased light. Oh, I know what you're thinking, 'State-run! What are you, a communist? That's a slippery slope!' No, I'm just a concerned citizen who would rather see a State-run news agency than an Oligarchic-big brother, run by the top 1% of 1%. Trust me, Stephen Burke and others don't want what's best for you. We wouldn't regulate the news agencies that already exist. We'd just create an additional one, run by an unaffected, third party; and it would only be used for situations such as this. Wait, don't we have something like that? Isn't it called C-SPAN? Yet, we agree to sell our political debates out? W. T. F.

2016-01-18T14:38:28Z,@DaquanDumas,ti2Nokoq1J4,"As a non-American this is my view on this: Bernie Sanders should be president. 

He's the only one that really gets it and wants to stand up against big money. Huge corporations and lobbygroups are deciding things in the US instead of the people. It doesn't matter if you get Clinton in the white house. she'll keep doing what Obama and Bush were doing. Listening to the people that gave them money because they are in the pocket of their backers. This is the main issue in American politics and Sanders is running without the backing of these big corporations and shady lobby groups. He's running on the money his own voters are donating. So he's no nobody's pocket.

This is also a reason a lot of people are voting on Trump but the only problem with Trump is that he's a radical. Bernie wants to bring change with logic and actual plans while  Trump is just screaming that he will change things but he has no real sollutions. He'll only make enemies and bully them. Trump is also dangerous because he's a billionaire himself. He's got a lot of personal financial stakes. He also comes across as a power hungry person. (this is my own subjective view). It's a man that names buildings after himself and is overly arrogant. You really don't think he cares about the working class right? I really don't get why certain republicans vote for him when they are in the working class themselfs. He doesn't care about their rights. 

The main thing Sanders has got against him is that people in the US don't understand democratic socialism and they link it with communism. While it has nothing to do with communism. A lot of countries in Europe are democratic solcialist countries. They still run on capitalistic values but they've got rights in their constitution that insure healthcare for every citizen for example.",2016-01-18T14:38:28Z

At this moment I feel he's the right man for the job. As for Hillary, I never supported her the last time she ran for president and I sure as hell won't support her now. She did bring up an interesting point about drug use. But that's the only one. Anyone who hasn't been under a rock should know about her relationship with wall street. She doesn't care about anything other than making history as the 1st woman president. I doubt she'd even be running if that historical spot was already filled. For the moment Bernie Sanders has my vote for president. We do need better Health Care no one will deny it. We need actual affordable health care, one where preexisting conditions don't matter and where gender and age don't matter either. The fines for not having health care need to go away. Having health care shouldn't be a law it should be a human right. Then there's O'Malley, I keep forgetting his name! I just refer to him as the other guy. He's not memorable to say the least nor was I moved or impressed with anything he said other than sustainable energy. But having to wait till 2050 for his plan to be in full effect is insane to say the least. We do need a long term shift like that but we also need a short term one to get us through till then. For a leader of this country we don't need more of the same; as anyone should be able to see it's not working. Our country is hanging by a thread, it's damn near an oligarchy. If you aren't a millionaire, then you're one illness, injury, or flat tire away from being homeless; and this has to end.

2016-01-18T19:19:59Z,@brandonbuchner1771,ti2Nokoq1J4,"+Wendy Lott I would like to agree and disagree with a few points. First Sanders is 100x more trustworthy than Clinton, so I agree with you there. I like the fact that he doesn't have a super PAC and that he gets his money from individual donors and Clinton is like an extension of the corrupt face of politics, so I agree with you there as well. I think as it stands, the ""Affordable"" health care act is a disgrace and is not affordable at all, so if Bernie is going to get in there and fix it so it becomes more affordable than that is great too. As a middle class American, if I had to use the government exchange for my health care,¬†I wouldn't be able to afford it. Fortunately, my job offers healthcare and it's much more affordable than what the government could provide. All that being said, one thing that really bothered me is that Sanders is now on board with taxing the middle class and justifying it by saying that healthcare premiums will be reduced. I don't have public health care, and I'm guessing that there are a lot of people in the middle class who don't have public health care, yet we have to accept that we are getting taxed when we were told that we wouldn't and our prize is that someone else's premiums go away? That's not fair. What else is not fair is nearly doubling the federal minimum wage. I'm an engineer.¬†Engineers who do what I do make between $20-$30 per hour. My wife is a stay at home mom with a master's degree because day care is crazy expensive. If minimum wage goes up to $15, but my wages don't proportionally increase, you could easily have a young couple who are high school dropouts, working at a fast food joint with a higher household income than us. I'm sorry, but if we going for income equality, how is that equal? Income equality is more than just ""everyone makes the same."" That's communism. I feel that because of how extreme left this party has gotten, a vote for any Democrat at this point is a vote to harm the middle class.Lastly, regarding sustainable energy, O'Malley's plan was to have the entire country sustainable by 2050. you think that is insane, but I think it is lofty. I work closely with architects and there is currently a plan in place already to have all new construction carbon neutral by 2030. That's just buildings. For the whole country to be carbon neutral, you still have power grids to overhaul, clean vehicles to get on the roads, manufacturing plants have to convert, and clean energy generation plants have to be erected across the country. And to get all of this done in only 34 years is an insanely fast timeline. Buildings are the number one consumer of energy in the United States and that is already being remedied, yet nobody talks about it. Why? Because we don't have to put any legislation in place to do it. Politicians need justification to create policy. It doesn't benefit them to talk about the 2030 initiative that has been in place for nearly a decade. We are at the forefront of energy efficiency. Our appliances are energy efficient, our cars are energy efficient, and now our buildings are energy efficient. At some point, we will finally have enough data to look at things and go either ""yes, we are making an impact"" or ""nope, we aren't fixing anything."" I think by 2050 we should be able to get a handle on whether or not we are making a difference.",2016-01-18T19:19:59Z

¬†Thank you for having a logical reply. Sadly, you and I are on both sides of the fence here and I don't think we'll be able to fully agree. You are one of the very few fortunate ones who are still middle class. I on the other hand am not. No, I'm not a drop out and I thankfully found a better job than fast food. But at the same time I do live on the $7.50 minimum wage working 38 hours a week. If you can call that living...I'm one year shy of having a Bachelor's Degree In Game Art Design and Programming. However, the only one who could send me to college died in 2012. Me being fresh out of high school in '05 and straight into college I had no credit. I still don't because all I can barely afford is groceries. And last I checked groceries don't build credit. I'm sorry that pulling me out of poverty and giving me an actual living wage threatens you. I'm sorry that $15 and hour would finally allow me to get my first car, my own home, and health insurance.Because my employer won't pay for any. I'm sorry that it would allow me to have a good night's sleep; and no longer need to pray that I don't get sick, or injured. or that my mom's car won't fail me because I can't afford to fix it. Much less have a car of my own. I suppose in your book that makes me a loser or lazy. So on that subject I don't know if you or I could find common ground. But as for energy. I only think it's insane to wait until 2050 for a full resolution and not have any kind of plan or short term solution to last us until then. And unless I misheard O'Malley I didn't hear him say anything about having one. But please point it out if he did and I'll certainly apologize for my ignorance and recant my statement. One final note though on raising the wage. You said it wouldn't be fair if the minimum went up but not yours. You're right, it wouldn't be. But forgive me if I'm ignorant for saying this but if my wage went up, wouldn't the economy get stronger therefore also increasing yours?",2016-01-18T20:39:09Z

Also Trump lied about the cost for the wall across the Mexican border.  He says it'll only cost ""a few million"" but economists did the math and say it's going to be over 100 billion, not including rounding up all illegal immigrants. 

Trump criticized China for stealing our jobs but has a factory in China making many of his products.  This was on video.  Pretty sure that's called being a hypocrite. 

Trump throughout his presidential run stated on multiple occasions that he supports a lower minimum wage.  Bernie Sanders criticized him harshly for that stance and right after doing so, Trump flip-flopped his position to supporting higher wages.  

Trump posted a false and racist statistic suggesting that whites killed by blacks was 81% , that whites killing whites was 16%, and that blacks killed by police is 1%.   The real statistic made by the FBI is that whites killed by black is 15%, whites killed by whites is 82%, and that official counts miss between 30 to 40 percent of all police-related deaths.

His friend Bill O'Reilly even called him out on that statistic telling Trump it was false.  Trump's response was that he doesn't have the time to check if all of his facts are correct........which essentially just admits that he's unreliable and everything he proposed is pretty much inaccurate. 

There are a lot more instances of him lying.  So I would say Bernie Sanders was right on the dot in saying so.",2016-01-18T22:00:59Z

Taxation of Wall Street speculation and trading is how we will pay for these things. Taxing wealthy investors on money they believe they can hide from the IRS (some of whom claim to be patriots - laughable) in other countries. Reforming our bloated military budget is how we will pay for things. Putting millions more Americans to work and raising their wages, which stimulates the economy, and brings in more sales tax, will pay for these things. Also, I seem to recall the policies that led this country into financial ruin being those of the Republican party, not Democrats (of course I know some Democrats voted for such policies).",2016-01-19T19:41:12Z

Of welfare, she remarked: ""Our liberal friends are just going to understand that we are going to go for welfare reform - for eliminating the welfare entitlement. They are just going to have to get used to it. I'm not going to listen to them or be sympathetic to them."" Seeing through her perpetual lies is so easy. You just have to be willing to look.

I believe that when he says 'he wants the police to look like the diversity of the neighborhood he works in' he means that he wants to build a sense of connection. It's easier to connect with someone of your own background. Incarceration is a huge problem now, and I believe that it's best when the neighborhood knows and can connect with the police that works in their neighborhood. There's a fine line separating the community between police enforcement today and I believe that Sanders posed that idea to try and solve that situation. That's just what I've gathered from that idea he mentioned. Anyway, each their own opinion.",2016-01-18T14:44:13Z

2016-01-18T17:26:35Z,@dariquewarren,ti2Nokoq1J4,+David Yummus I just want to say that it makes sense hire and assign police to communities that they are a part of. it helps the police deal with the nuances of community relations. I'm from Manhattan NY. Most of our police live far from their assigned precincts.  it takes years for then to really get to know a neighborhood. making an us vs them attitude seem good and expedient,2016-01-18T17:26:35Z

I don't think any Police Officer could afford to live in Manhattan could they ?
I understand his ""idea"" but it's too much like Affirmative Action (IMO) which I have personally seen to be a disaster.
Maybe team 1 Black or White Cop with 1 Latino Cop in a Latino neighborhood but not all ¬†Latino in that neighborhood.
Where I live in Central PA, the local town has just had to remove restrictions of having to live in that town to be a cop in that town because they struggled to get cops to join,... The Police wanted to live in surrounding towns perceived to be ""better"" towns so I think that disconnect will always be there unless an effort is made by the public & the Police. ¬†",2016-01-18T17:43:12Z

Bernie says hes going to raise minimum wage to $15 dollars, but how is that going to change anything? For example, let's say a small local restaurant is paying its workers $10 an hour. If they are required to pay their workers $15 an hour, where are they suppose to get the money to do so? Are they going to have to raise their menu prices in order to pay their workers as well as keep their profits from declining? Are they going to have some workers become unemployed in order to pay the workers they keep?",2016-01-18T11:21:02Z

For example, lets say a kung pao chicken dish is $10 when min wage is $10.

Second, you have to take into consideration that inflation and productivity have skyrocketed since 1980, but wages have barely gone up since then. It has been proven time and time again that properly increasing the minimum wage helps stimulate the economy by putting more money in the hands of the workers which leads to more spending which fuels small businesses. It helps pull more people out of poverty, leads to happier lives and increases productivity.",2016-01-18T12:23:43Z

If those tips are shared with the kitchen staff, they MAY opt to pay them lower than minimum. However, usually those in the back get paid min wage, and those upfront get a smaller wage + tips. What the reality is, is that if we see a minimum wage at 15 dollars an hour, the restaurants will be forced to raise their prices. If the consumers are willing to pay the higher prices, then there is no effect, but if their business suffers due to higher prices, then they may close. No solution is perfect.",2016-01-18T22:24:35Z

You hire based on qualifications. If all cops in a mostly black town are white then so be it as long as they are qualified and respect the law.  Affirmative action is also the most racist action in determining college admission. If a black high school kid can't qualify to get into a university let them go to community college and better prepare themselves , not kick out a more qualified white person to let them in. 




Minimum wage is also racist. Demanding that a business gives more money to unskilled workers takes away their strive to better themselves. It makes them think they can stay on minimum wage the rest of their lives. That's not what the minimum wage was made for. It's for young people to have first jobs on their resumes.

He understands the economy like a chimp, he has a non existent foreign policy, and he doesnt even have leadership skills. His top socialist utopias that he keeps yapping away about can be destroyed with a few simple facts. Denmark debt/capita $101 000, Sweden $91 000 and BOTH have a declining population. They dont even have to maintain a big military like the US to keep world peace. Massive debt, sky high taxes, sky high gas prices, declining population, small military and STILL failing.
And then theres my personal experience that ALL of the hardcore socialists Ive talked to in the past few years admitted that the only reason they support socialism is because it leads to communism. And these were real hardcore socialists/marxists that sent me entire essays explaining why communism is good, also they talked like college professors.
Inb4 any indoctrinated leftist drone starts raging at me on how hes a democratic socialist, socialism vs democratic socialism is like bullshit vs sugar coated bullshit. And make no mistake based on what he said, he is in fact a socialist.
Also what will happen when he weakens the US military to be able to pay for all that free money he wants to throw around? Im sure Crimea2 wont happen in the Baltics. And China building new islands in the pacific? Naah. But if the Baltics are invaded its ww3. Brought to you by comrade Sanders.
Or how about his irrational plan to tie the police's hands behind their backs when it comes to black criminals? Im sure that wont result in skyrocketing crime rates due to black criminals that no longer have to fear getting killed by the police no matter what they do right? And which race makes up the majority of the victims of black criminals? Blacks themselves.
Lets recap what we have so far. Chimp understanding of the economy, non existent foreign policy, $10/gallon gas like in his top socialist utopias and skyrocketing crime rates. I only feel sorry for the poor indoctrinated cant think for themselves leftist snowflakes that support Bernie Bolshevik Sanders.

Hillary is poised, has specific plans (that are not changed 2 hours before a debate), has the experience to actually say what she means/ has witnessed and answers her questions fully and eloquently. She does not make grandiose promises about social revolutions of millions to overthrow the evil rich: instead, she talks of progress, feasible progress, working with the right end, building on progress made - and being strategic.

I know this is a waste of time *insert a long story about why socialism is good, I mean democratic socialism, and YES I KNOW ABOUT ECONOMICS, IT'S ABOUT MONEY AND GIVING IT TO THE PEOPLE NOT THE 1%*

I went online and Bernie wants to give everyone equality by offering FREE COLLEGE, FREE HEALTHCARE, WE CAN BECOME EDUCATED AND BEAT OTHER COUNTRIES WITH SMALL RICH POPULATIONS *Insert how most of Europe is doing good, lol well not Greece, France, Spain, or those countries pfft* *insert how socialism is working in Europe, sorry I meant democratic socialism* 

Guys please vote for Bernie! He is for the people, and the educated, against the 1% who are monsters, against the rich, want equality for all! EQUALITY FOR ALL! RICH AND POOR SHOULDN'T EXIST, ONLY MIDDLE CLASS, WHICH WE CAN DO BY PROVING THE SAME EDUCATION TO THE PEOPLE!

How does he think he can accomplish what others have tired for decades and failed!  He's just yelling, complaining about wall street and the wealthy, but  hasn't produced a formulated plan to fix it. He's the that's all talk and no show!  And, lets be clear... he's more back paddling then any of the candidates;  e.g. last debate ""No Tax"" increase on the middle class, this debate the middle class will be taxed.  Doesn't sound like much of a solution when the middle class is already struggling.  TAX THE WEALTHY... get it all done with higher taxes on them and leave the middle class alone.  Hilary stated has numerous times, she will not execute her policies at the expense of the middle class.... all I can say, the majority of what Bernie is promising will not happen and then the country will be hating him just has people turned on President Obama.",2016-01-18T09:00:31Z

Sanders would get in there and scream and shout, get no support and be impotent for the remainder of his term because he is not pragmatic. He's an ideologue. I want a sly person who thinks ten steps ahead of her opponents. I like Sanders but he does not have the personal qualities, I think we need right now. we need a pragmatic fighter, not a visionary warrior. The former does the day to day battle of change the latter tries to make sweeping shifts. some time the latter is great but it won't work in this environment.

There's no quick fixes for the myriad of problems our country has and chances are, some things will need to get worse before it gets better. My only issue with the pragmatic fighter is that those changes are slow and incremental and some of the basis' for the issues are the real problem (corporate interests mean more than what the people want) and may need a much bigger change to create anything meaningful (making the people aware of the issues and having them participate in that debate).

Second Swedens economy was not affected by the 2008 crisis at all, if we did not follow the news no one here would even know about the crisis. Second the Sweden like all economically wealthy nations has a low birth rate, people do not want more then two children, this is true for all nations that are dominated by a large middle class.

Sweden has been run with social democratic policies for 100 years now, longer then you have had the current form of Reaganomics in your nation, our middle class is much larger, our GDP per capita is greater then the US, we pay for healthcare and collage with our taxes, while you pay around 10-15k a year for insurance, we do not need to save around 200k per child to allow them to leave collage debt free, this by any normal standards mean that our standard of life is higher then you have in the US currently, your taxes go to corporations, banks and wars, the so called recovery in the US has been made by the Upper class, your middle class is shrinking¬†as we speak¬¥.

What you need to understand is that the US is the richest nations in the World, this does not reflect on your people, in fact it only reflects on a tiny portion of your nation, you seam to be fine with paying taxes for wars, corporate welfare, banks while you oppose spending that tax money to educate your nation, to heal them with better healthcare, to allow people who are not lazy and work for a living make a wage that they can live on,¬† for me in Sweden, the idea of having a job and still being poor is so absurd i can't understand it, the fact that people need more then one job just to pay their bills should put your whole nation to shame!",2016-01-18T15:31:20Z

Wrong. Im talking about the same debt that everybody keeps yapping about when they talk about the US debt. I get my numbers from the same list, look it up on google ""list of countries by external debt"" US $58 000, Sweden $91 000, Norway $131 000, Denmark $101 000.

Wrong again, all countries were affected by the financial crisis, but since Sweden's government was already taking alot of money from the people it wasnt affected that badly. You can sugar coat the birthrate thing however you want, people cant really afford more than 1-2 kids. Then you have to import a horde of third world people that will have like 4-5 kids because their standards are low, just to have a growing population again.

Wow you even suck at history. To your entire third paragraph of bullshit, Im just gonna remind you of the 1970s when Sweden almost went communist. So try again telling us how well Sweden has it all figured out when you have a massive debt, sky high taxes and gas prices, people in your country cant even afford more than 1-2 kids and your military is quite small.

Your second sentence should be terribly relevant to a good president. It is very important what others think of our president because our president is a reflection of us. They are our representative, so they should represent our values. The values of America are that EVERYONE is equal before the law, and that if you come to America you can achieve your dreams. Trump does not represent those values with his policies if he wants to create second class citizens out of Muslim Americans.

You say ""This is why we have politicians making the tough decisions not idiots like you""¬†

This time the BJP won by a landslide so they were able to form practically a non-coalition based govt. But, since they're also involved in individual states assembly elections, they have to make compromises.

Most of the legislative assemblies of each state and the Parliament of the country don't get many bills passed into legislature because¬† of ego clashes, corruption allegations and primarily, a large scale Show-The-Finger-To-Someone-Else political blame game.

They spark communal statements also from time to time.

Now, who is going to pay for ""free college"" specifically? His plan is to tax some transactions on wall street, make of this plan as you will. So the 1% (more like the 0.01% to be significant enough to be trading on wallstreet) is basically going to finance public college for the youth of the United States.


On the 90% tax myth: Bernie Sanders said ""I'm not going as big as Eisenhower who had it at 90%."" Somehow this went to 90%. Secondly, 90% is a marginal tax rate, meaning that  it only applies to you if you are very very rich. Plus, marginal tax rates work that only your income ABOVE that margin is taxed at 90%. Including deductibles, the richest under Eisenhower payed more like 40% in income taxes, not 90%. 
TL;DR: Unless you are very rich, marginal tax rates will not affect you. If you are very rich, you really can afford to pay back to the society that supported you (or was supposed to support you) when you were a child.",2016-01-18T14:25:42Z

It's going to be collectively paid for by the middle class and the upper class (the upper class should be paying a higher share).

The same way that K-12 is publicly funded, higher education can also be publicly funded. This would reduce the inequality in our society because it gives everyone a fair chance if they have the skills and knowledge to attend college. Healthcare can also be collectively funded to eliminate the middle man (insurance companies) who want to make a profit and drive prices up and quality down. If we collectively fund and make it universal we reduce the overheads that we currently have (all the paperwork, co-pay, deductables, premiums) for healthcare access. This would reduce cost even more. I'm 25 and I totally understand where Bernie Sanders is trying to take us. It's the next logical step after the Affordable Care Act. We will pay more taxes, but when you consider you won't have the overheads and premiums you will actually save a lot of money after the fact. Look at other developed countries across the world and how they have done it successfully to have cheaper universal healthcare. If they can do it, WE can do it.",2016-01-18T14:54:44Z

Our use of technology makes us look lazy and makes us look as if we don't know what hard work is. That just isn't the case. A lot of us, including myself work full time and go full time to school. You making the assumption that we do not know hard work is simply a lazy excuse for people like you to try to make our generation look bad. A lot of us don't work blue collar jobs for a few reasons: 1. My dad has worked a blue collar job all his life and I respect him for it, however I've seen his health go to hell the last few years. He's 50 years old and can barely walk because of his back. 2. With blue collar jobs you usually can't go to school. It's one or the other. And 3. Blue collar jobs just aren't for a lot of people in our generation. We value education a lot more than we value the money that would come from a blue collar job. It's not for a lot of us. We choose the education route instead which is something that a lot of people didn't choose back 30+ years ago. To us, education is everything, not money. We want to be able to work the job we want and have the career we want. When I was growing up I was even specifically told by my dad to ""Make sure you get an education, son. You don't want to be all beat and broken down by the age of 45 because you've had to work a job like mine"". Please don't tell us that we're lazy and don't know what hard work is when clearly we do. We have higher levels of anxiety and stress than mental patients did in the 50's and yet we still seem to work full time and go to school full time, while also meeting the demands of our parents and elders. Even though we get little to no respect from our elders who always seem to demand respect but never earn it or give us the respect we deserve and earn.",2016-01-18T16:06:48Z

Bernie, however, says what he thinks is true and best, and doesn't seem to care if others haven't come around yet. There are a few examples of Bernie being ahead of the game, in terms of progressive values, and Hilary being late to the game. Also, to be fair, Elizabeth Warren shares Bernie's authentic dedication to progressive values, and if she had run, I would have been torn between her and Bernie.

ISIS and other terror groups are a huge issue and threat to us, and we will need soldiers in the region, weather a small force of special OPs troops to act as a counter effort against their operations or a larger police force there to ensure those terrorists dont leave their home nations, but I think we really should STOP training, arming, and supporting these regimes in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia is committing Human Rights violations and he is NOT alone. 

We failed to keep thousands of people safe from their own crazed dictator and his chemical weapons(Which are illegal according to the Geneva convention) even though we said we would act! We are too weak with this. 

If someone attacks us, they must die. We cant allow anyone to threaten our lifestyles, homes, and people. 

As for Russia, why are we still enemies with them? The cold war ended. The Russian people are very similar to us, yet we still treat them as the old Red Menace. The USSR and the Warsaw Pact fell, yet we held on to NATO(The organization to counter the Warsaw Pact). We need to disband NATO and start working WITH Russia instead of against them. Its no longer a matter of old hate, but a matter of current threats, like climate change, ISIS, drugs, and nations that commit mass atrocities against people all over the world.",2016-01-18T07:48:41Z

Bernie is absolutely a 3 trick pony, but that's not a bad thing. He's dedicated to his key points of the inequality of well being in our nation and cleaning up the mess of what's actually 20 years of Reagan (Reagan himself for 8 years, his VP Bush for 1, and that dude's son for 8. Hence 20 years of Reagan, and zero NON Reagan-tied republican administrations since) left us with since the 80's. Hillary, contrary to the statements by NBC commentators, was the center and focus of this debate, not Bernie. They set Bernie up to get stuck in his 3 platform rut while HRC danced nimbly around him on multiple stances.
I still say this is going to be Clinton v Bush, no matter what the primary votes are. I truly believe the party leadership have agreed to this Ali vs Tyson fantasy fight just because of the names involved and how they are firmly controlled by their parties. Trump is a well-paid decoy to keep heat off Jeb, while the rest run for Running Mate honors to Jeb. Clinton is being sold to us by the ""strong underdog"" narrative, representative of everyone who isn't a white guy, while Bernie gets the doddering old kook treatment, as the polar counterpart to Trump.

2016-01-18T07:11:01Z,@jimjackle6282,ti2Nokoq1J4,"Bernie tries to portray himself as an outsider, but he has been a career politician his whole life. I think Bernie is a sincere guy that has good intentions, but socialism has been proven to be a failed system. Look what happened to the USSR when they tried socialism, the kids were eating bread and water for lunch at school. Socialism sounds good on paper, but it always leads to collapse in the end. When you start taking from the rich and giving to the poor, eventually everyone is poor. We need to get Trump elected and bring back our high paying manufacturing jobs from China, Mexico, Japan etc. We need someone like him that knows how to deal with financial matters and make our country rich like it used to be. Hillary is funded big time by several corporations like Wal Mart and Tyson foods. Wal Mart doesn't want Trump putting tariffs on their Chinese made crap, because they would be forced to buy American goods where people are paid a decent salary. Tyson foods, which employees tens of thousands of illegals in their chicken slaughter houses, doesn't want a wall to keep out their cheap labor from Mexico and central America. If that happened they would have to offer a higher salary to attract America workers, because American people won't do grueling factory jobs for 8 bucks an hour like the illegals will. We need to stop these illegals that have driven down wages and ruined much of our economy. Used to be that housing construction jobs were high paying, but since the illegals flooded in, construction jobs don't pay much anymore.",2016-01-18T07:11:01Z

But you have no right to forget what she has said earlier when popular opinion made different demands. In an interview with Larry King, she said, ""there is no Left in the Clinton White House."" Of welfare, she remarked: ""Our liberal friends are just going to understand that we are going to go for welfare reform - for eliminating the welfare entitlement. They are just going to have to get used to it. I'm not going to listen to them or be sympathetic to them."" Seeing through her perpetual lies is so easy. You just have to be willing to look.

I was chosen at random to lead the opposition side against the Affordable Care Act to amend it and not repeal it and our team won. Moderators included those from the hospital industry such as Memorial Care Hospitals, Insurance Companies, and Health Care Administration faculty. When you look at Bernie Sanders approach to driving down cost that are associated with the hospital master charge bill sent to insurance & government run health plans there  has  been a steady increase in those charges. The reason being is that private insurance continues to exist and will always pass it off to the consumer in the form of price toward higher premiums, co-pays, and prescription drug pricing. I've worked in both mental health care and now for the leading hospital in Orange County so I've seen both sides of the payer system. If you believe an individual who looks down every time she lies (that's called reading body language presentation in mental health) then I feel very sorry for the American future that my children will be a part of( I don't have them yet as I'm only 25). I only wish that I could have been one of the video questions to ask all the candidates actual hard questions from the real experience I've been involved with on multiple sides of the healthcare industry. Please for all our sake look towards the future and don't extend your willing vote for a sub par democratic candidate that is backed by big banks and secular media coercion. Please vote Sanders in for president of the United States of America! P.S. The scholarship money I won from the healthcare debate only paid for half of my tuition.

Due to both Bill, Hillary, John, and many others being a part of the Rockefeller initiative, she is likely more informed than other potential candidates that crucial information is being withheld illegally. That said, I doubt the powers that be would willingly read Hillary into any USAPs (Unrecognized Special Access Programs) or provide any other info unless she specifically targeted various individuals and installations, likely requiring the threat of military task forces being deployed domestically.

Many groups that were formerly united under Hussein broke into factions that were armed, unemployed because of the destruction taking place in their country, and very angry. The population of Iraq, mostly Shiite, who were formerly oppressed under Hussein now held majority power and began to fight with the Sunni groups, many of whom fled to Syria. When the US turned its attention to Syria, and began its campaign to depose Assad, the US funded, armed, trained, and fought alongside these former Iraqi army Sunnis, who were the ""rebel forces"" that the USA allied with (this is on record.) These particular rebels were exceptionally brutal in their fighting tactics but we allied with them, paid them, and trained them as weapons against Assad's regime. After some time, the rebels no longer saw it beneficial to ally with the Americans, since they hated them all along for invading their nation in Iraq. THIS IS THE GROUP THAT BECAME ISIS.  Some terrorism is caused by climate change issues like drought, but be careful with your wording here. I'm a Sanders supporter, and I think you mean well with your comment, but to simplify the formation of ISIS down to ""people got angry at their government over droughts"" will get you defeated in argument almost every time.

copy and paste not my words

It may surprise you to know that Russia has a more direct presidential election process than the United States. In the United States, a system called the Electoral College
 periodically allows a candidate who receives fewer popular votes to win
 an election. In fact, there have been several presidential candidates 
who won the popular vote, but lost the election because they received 
fewer electoral votes. In Russia, where no such system exists, the 
candidate who r¬≠eceives a majority of popular votes wins the election.",2016-01-18T15:35:33Z

*""....gun control is not important...""*

No. How many of us were saying it's not an important issue vs it not being an important issue to *them*? There is a distinction.

Would I like less guns in America? Yes! Would I like to follow the U.K, Australia, and other countries model of dealing with guns?! Yes!

However, back in America, is it number one issue with me? No. I know it sucks to have prioritize but grow up.

But, since you seem intent to have the against racism moral high-ground, how about this; The two issues most important to me are education and evironmental issues and on a larger scale, climate change. Issues that can take on a racism angle, as well. There you go! Get your anti-racism smugness on!

*""...since it is mostly black children being killed...""*

Oh, so now Bernie doesn't care about my fellow blacks?! Yes, you read that right, I'm a black female.

http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/20-examples-bernie-sanders-powerful-record-civil-and-human-rights-1950s

Bernie doesn't care about other ethnics? Back that up, please.

*""Bernie did accept money from the NRA.""*

When? When during this campaign did Bernie take money from the NRA?!

*""I have no time to do the legwork for your lazy ass.""*

Says always the person that can never back up their claims. No, hunnybunny, your claim, your burden to prove. Even my ""lazy"" ""black"" ""ass"" could pull up two example of Bernie's non-racism against non-whites. And I wasn't even making a claim.

I end this comment with this--black people, white people and the rainbow in-between stop believing *every* black experience is the same. It's not. There are those of us that can honestly not recall a ""racist"" event done to them¬†in their entire lives. Just keep that in mind.

On top of that, he's an admitted Socialist which is just a step away from Communism, as Vladimir Lenin so humbly demonstrated in the USSR. 

For those that don't know, Bernie went to Communist Soviet Union for his honeymoon during the cold war era to study their social systems. Before that he went to Socialist/Communist Nicaragua while the US was at war with them to learn from their Socialist, Revolutionary, felon President (whom Bernie hailed as a good person). Around the same time he also gave praise to Cuba's Fidel Castro for educating the children and transforming their society for the better... though thousands upon thousands of refugees have fled from Cuba over the span of decades due to oppressive government and lack of opportunity. (This is all true. All of these videos are also on youtube to see, go search them)

This guy truly is looking for a revolution and should be strongly compared to the Democratic Socialist, turned Marxist/Communist, Vladimir Lenin. This is how these types of societies begin, people. Someone feeds into the fears of a class warfare and then encourages a 'positive' revolution that slowly changes over time. Remember, once you give Government power, they don't like giving it back! Bernie wants to slowly put the power and money under Government control. Starting with healthcare and college plans.

For two, places like Sweden and other places in Europe have been having problems with their systems and costs have been rising. Now they're privatizing across the continent to a certain level to help pay for the costs.

On top of that, with a Single Payer plan, there are less doctors, which means it can take from 2-6 months + for YOU to see a doctor, even when you need a surgery. That's common and it's somewhat typical for Canadians to cross to the United States to get quicker and BETTER care. You have to realize, with a universal plan, there is a line to get to see the fewer doctors that are available and you'll be waiting based on who is most urgent.

Even more, Bernie already tried to roll out a plan like this in his state of Vermont. They found out afterwards that it was far more expensive than they thought. Which meant to keep it they would have to raise taxes even more than they had originally promised the Vermont citizens. They ended up scrapping it due to those extra costs. That could just as easily end up happening again... that you pay more than they originally budget for. So you'd be paying more for lower quality medical care, all while having longer waiting lines. Just something you should know. It's not an efficient system, especially for the most obese nation on the planet where cost are likely to go up anyways due to the increased risk of diabetes and heart disease. More taxes for you.

And Bernie's plans are to raise taxes all around. The numbers don't even add up, especially considering he just laid out his tax plan for a 52% Federal tax on the rich. They JUST tried this on the rich in France and you know what happened? The rich people took their money and businesses to other countries! They left.

2016-01-18T14:26:15Z,@rayfinkle9369,ti2Nokoq1J4,"Homo Sapiens¬†Of course I'm not labeling all of his supporters as millenials. A large percentage of his base, however, are from this group and use youtube, so I'm talking to that base. Not to mention, being a younger generation, they're less likely to be fully aware of the things he's suggesting.

There's a reason why we don't have a socialist President in our history. Because their systems wouldn't work. Bernie likes to quote that Eisenhower was more of a socialist than he was, but let's be honest. Eisenhower was a Republican, and he campaigned AGAINST communism. The idea that he had a 90% tax rate and the country flourished is entirely misleading. The MARGINAL tax rate was some 90%, but the EFFECTIVE tax rate (that which was actually collected) was almost exactly the same as the effective rate today. Almost identical. To say that the economy was good even considering his high tax rate does not take that into consideration. Almost no one paid that due to loopholes, write-offs and other credits. To try that again, like Bernie wants, is just not smart. Especially after I just mentioned that France did this exact same thing and it blew up in their faces not 2 years ago. The rich people left and took their business elsewhere. It was a failure.¬†

Of course some big business have taken themselves overseas already. It's because we have one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. Making it even higher does NOT encourage them to come back, I assure you. China is at 25% and we can't even compete. Making it LOWER brings back business. Not higher. That's just common sense.

The reason we struggle for money is not because of income inequality. Most everyone I know is doing fine. Everyone I know that isn't doing fine are horrible at managing their lives and managing their money. They have too many children, they set no budget, they buy on credit... which is the real problem. People buying on credit when they can't afford to pay it back. That's exactly what our government is doing. We have $20 Trillion in debt, they keep running it up with huge deficits, never cut spending, losing jobs overseas because our corporate taxes don't compete with almost any other country, the Veterans Affairs are run horribly... and you all are comfortable having the government handle your money? They're so poor at managing money and they have the record to show it. Bernie wants to have MORE government control. They get more money and appropriate it for us. No thanks.

I've seen his speeches. They're filled with lots of buzz words to get people stirred up. Just like Trump with immigration, terrorism... Bernie uses big banks and wall street crooks. It's all the same to tap into concerned voters. It's just rhetoric. Banks and Wall Street is not the reason why poor people are poor. A lack of good jobs is what keeps them poor (number one). A lack of good education and 'fiscal responsibility' keeps them poor. And every candidate is addressing this. Making free healthcare and free college is only going to work so long as Bernie's rich people don't pack up and leave or run out of money to take from. Too bad more people don't understand this.",2016-01-18T14:26:15Z

I don't know where you get 'smart ideas' when I just told you the French tried to do what Bernie wants not 2 years ago and businesses and the wealthy left town and the French had to change their tax policy back.

Sanders is a straight shooter, a man who for 40 years has fought for the little guy against every special interest in Washington. He has always made it clear he will rip up these anti-American trade deals that benefit the rich donor class, and has been a strong advocate of investing in America and the quality of life of Americans, not foreign adventures and corporate welfare.

What i dont understand is this. Bernie want to break up the banks.. But that is a stupid idea..  The reason why banks have grown and became powerful after the bail out is because of small businesses.. creating jobs and starting one.. Hillary is right is better to control the them than to break them up.. Bernie wants to create more powerful banks..let's  say  Instead of 5 banks he want break them up and make 10 out of them..

From what you told me, you are assuming that billionaires are already being taxed a large amount (35% to be exact) and you also claim that I think they are only being taxed at 1%, which is preposterous. However, recent statistics show that the top 1% OF PEOPLE still have more wealth than all of the bottom 90% combined. If billionaires are already being taxed a huge chunk of money, why are the bottom 90% still losing money while the rich gain more? I will gladly provide my sources if you wish me to. Secondly, where in my previous statement did I say I would support increasing the minimum wage? I am completely against decision. So please stay on topic when you are arguing to make a point.
